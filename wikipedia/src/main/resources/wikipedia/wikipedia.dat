Those supporting deletion successfully establish the lack of significant third-party coverage, yet those supporting keeping the article note the success of the business, while it does not make the subject ''inherently'' notable, contributes to an argument thereof, and some argue that there are sufficient sources for inclusion (e.g., Ktr101).

Several third party sources identify metrics which I wouldn't consider "trivial" or "incidental" as per [[WP:CORP|the notability guidline on corporations]] and could even be considered inherently notable, such as [http://finance.yahoo.com/news/beacon-roofing-acquire-mcclure-johnston-130251881.html;_ylt=A0LEVxM23VhU2OwAbvBXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEzY2RxajU3BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA1ZJUDUzMl8x almost $100 in annual sales], [http://www.prosalesmagazine.com/news/distributors/beacon-roofing-supply-opens-location-no-200_o opening over 200 stores, recording almost $2 billion in total sales] and being a large, publicly traded company.

But I was unable to find anything in the article itself or this discussion so far that matched it, and the total there is not sufficient. GraniteSand's sources are warmed-over press releases. That the company is NASDAQ-listed does not in my experience demonstrate the existence of good coverage.  Still, with a $1B+ market cap, I would guess that coverage may still exist, yet to be found, perhaps in specialized industry periodicals. The topic ''may'' be able to show notability if a sufficiently informed editor has access to appropriate sources and builds an article from them.

No exclusion of analyst reports is made, and indeed it is specifically cited as material that conveys notability.  What you consider boring, routine stuff, people interested in business consider exciting.  Business writing normally covers financials (but note most such reports also give background info on what the company does) by people paid to cover financials.  That doesn't make it any less reliable or indepth - the actual notability requirements - nor does it make it indiscriminiate (business analsysts/reports do choose what they write about - no one blindly covers every company in existance!).

Later into the 1900s the Nepalese tea producers acted as suppliers to Darjeeling factories when tea bushes became old and yields decreased.<ref name=mishra/> Orthodox tea now provides a source of sustainability for almost 20 000 farmers in Nepal.<ref name=mishra/> Farmers are supported by the National Tea and Coffee Development Board created by the Nepalese Ministry of Agriculture.<ref name=ntcdb>NTCDB.

There is also that one still has to click on this section editing button, which could be avoided, especially considering the time it takes to load visual editor. So a way to save the changes without leaving visual editor would be most welcome. [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]] ([[User talk:Cenarium|talk]]) 06:05, 1 December 2014 (UTC)  [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]], I think that you want the [[WP:keyboard shortcuts#List_of_access_keys|keyboard shortcuts]], which work anywhere on the page.

This link will show you the names of the objects that you want to change:  https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Candy&uselang=qqx  There is no way to skip the invitation to provide an edit summary, and I'm certain that this is a WONTFIX issue with the product manager.

I want to remain in visual editor mode after the save. I make edits, I save my edits without leaving visual editor, I edit again, and so on. It would make editing easier and faster, having to use shortcuts is too much of a hassle and it takes too long for visual editor to load. So I think it's a feature that would be very helpful and appreciated, particularly by experienced users. I would suggest a checkbox "stay in visual editor mode after saving". (I would even suggest to have a "visual editor always on" option in preferences, but only further down the line, when performance will have improved.) :Thanks, I know how to hide in css but not how to change a label, so I'll ask at VPT (and I'll update [[WP:CSS#Tips_and_tricks]]).

Is it not possible yet ? :I was not suggesting skipping the window as a feature request, but as something that 'power' users could do using personal js. I've thought of something better though : :I would strongly suggest to offer an option to have the edit summary window and minor edit checkbox (everything else is superfluous, or should be allowed to be hidden) together with the edit window, as in source editing. I see two possibilities, both could be offered and the user would choose according to their preference (mostly based on abundance of vertical space versus horizontal space on their respective platform). Either right below the visual editor menu toolbar, or in another box on the left side of the window where the navigation bar takes lots of unused space.

When working on an article, editors tend to make several edits in succession rather than a big one for several reasons, the main of those being edit conflicts. This would matter even more in visual editor since resolving conflicts would presumably require wikitext editing, which would defeat the purpose of said visual editor. So there should be a way to save without leaving, the visual editor window should update with the user's edit (and non-conflicting edits by other users). :::I've tried using custom js to reload the visual editor immediately after leaving it, as a script for wikitext editor does, but couldn't get js to work with visual editor, see section below.

Tiki taka is his playing style, one may say that the attacking middle fielder is not much of a dribbler but rather makes it up with accurate short passes that create scoring chances.  As a youth, he played for Set Green Hills academy, park center high school , PSC Soccer Academy and Prairie seeds academy.  Before joining FC Minneapolis Mumbo played with Portugal FC as a middle fielder.  He later on joined the Czechoslovakia side, SK Aritma Praha until when he suffered a fatal knee injury that saw him return to the US in the spring of 2014 to sign a Pro Transition Contract with FC Minneapolis.  "Mumbo is a promising player so full of football and mystery. I just can't wait to see what he's going to become here at FC Minneapolis" Smith said.  Due to his Brazilian playing style, Mumbo has been nick named Daudinho by the FC Minneapolis media, a title that fits him whenever he appears before the ball.  <ref>http://www.fcminneapolis.com/#!duadley-muambo/c1cyt</ref>  <ref>http://www.fcminneapolis.com/#!Will-Moore-and-Chen-Yifu-score-as-FC-Minneapolis-draws-with-Hazzelwood-Park/c11iu/45ED5E78-0594-4A91-B98E-2B99D0D4DDF6</ref></text></page>",

"<page><title>Maglekilde</title><text>[[Image:Maglekilde.JPG|thumb|200px|Maglekilde]] '''Maglekilde''' is the most powerful of several natural springs in [[Roskilde]], [[Denmark]]. It formerly issued water at a rate of some 90,000 litres per hour but has now dropped to 15,000 litres per hour. A wellhouse was built over the spring in 1927. It is now listed.  ==History==  ===Early history=== Extensive deposits of [[travertine]] from Maglekilde were mined and used as a building material before bricks became readily available. Several churches in the Rokilde area were built in travertine from the spring in the 11th and 12th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/da_DK/maglekilden-i-roskilde|title=Maglekilden I Roskilde|publisher=Kulturstyrelsen|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> This activity resulted in the formation of a pond which was used as a [[mill pond]]. The watermill at the site was called Maglekilde Watermill (''Maglekilde Mølle''). The water from the spring also powered five other watermills on its way to [[Roskilde Fjord]]: Vandhulsmølle, Sankt Mortens Mølle, Kapelsmøllen, Sankt Clara Mølle and Strandmøllen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roskildemuseum.dk/vores-viden/nyere-tid/fredede-huse-i-roskilde-og-lejre.aspx|title=Fredede huse i Roskilde og Lejre|publisher=Roskilde Museum|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> Maglekilde Watermill is first mentioned by name in 1258 but it most likely included in the [[prebendary|prebend]] of one of the [[canon (priest)|canon]]s at the [[cathedral chapter]] in 1253.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/1200/enkeltaar/1250-99/1253.htm|title=1264|publisher=Roskildes Historie|accessdate=13 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref>  ===Maglekilde Paper and Textile Mill=== On 8 April 1731, Maglekilde Watermill was the first of the buildings which were destroyed in the series of devastating fires that hit Roskilde in 1731.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/1700/billeder/bystyre/ildebrande/brand1.htmhtml|title=Brandene I 1731|publisher=Roskildes Historie|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> A new paper mill was built on the site in 1737<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fam-schuwendt.dk/onewebmedia/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Papirmagerne%20og%20Mundus%20familien.pdf|title=Papirmagerne og Mundus familien.|publisher=fam-schuwendt.dk|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> and it was joined by a textile mill in 1761.

"<page><title>The Coolin</title><text>'''The Coolin''', or The Coolun, is an Irish air often characterised as one of the most beautiful in the [[Irish traditional music|traditional repertoire]].  In Irish, its name has been given as  ''An Chúileann'' or ''An Chúilfhionn'' ("the fair haired girl" or "the fair lady") depending on the text used. The tune is also known as "The Lady of the Desert".  ==History==  The air, and the texts fitted to it, have a long and very complex history. Its exact provenance is unknown, but it has been variously asserted by different authors as dating from the 13th century, from the time of [[Henry VIII]], or from the 17th century, though the latter is the most credible.<ref name=donnellan1112>Donnellan, L. "Traditional Irish and Highland Airs", in Quinn (ed.), ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', vol 3, no. 1 (1912), 11-12</ref> There are at least two main Irish language texts and a number of later English translations, or interpretations of both; there are also English words (such as those by [[Thomas Moore|Moore]]) which are not a translation of either Irish version.  ===The air===  The air itself is sometimes claimed to have been composed by [[Turlough O'Carolan|Carolan]], though John Glen (1900) said that the "ancient Irish melody" was in fact usually known as "Molly St George" at the beginning of the 18th century.<ref name=glen218>Glen, J. ''Early Scottish melodies: including examples from mss. and early printed works'', AMS, 1900, p.218</ref> The latter-named tune has been often been associated with the great 17th-century harper [[Thomas Connellan]]. Connellan was also cited alongside Carolan as a possible composer of The Coolin, but as Glen noted, many supposed "that the tune is older than either of them".<ref name="glen218"/>  The version of The Coolin printed by [[Edward Bunting]] in ''The Ancient Music of Ireland '' (1840) was taken from the playing of [[Donnchadh Ó Hámsaigh]] (Dennis Hempson), who himself claimed to have learned it from the playing of [[Cornelius Lyons]] early in the previous century. Though Bunting's setting claims to present the tune with variations, it in fact appears to print only Lyons' once-fashionable baroque variations while omitting the main tune.<ref name=jifss>''Journal of the Irish folk Song Society'', v1-2, Wm. Dawson, 1967, p.32</ref> [[Patrick Weston Joyce]], who said that Bunting's version was "wanting in simplicity", printed a version of the tune collected from the playing of a fiddler, Hugh O'Beirne, that he said was very similar to that he recalled being sung in his youth in 1830s [[County Limerick]].<ref name=joyce299>Joyce, ''Old Irish Folk Music and Songs'', 1909, p.299</ref>  Other versions appeared in several late 18th century collections, as well as in the 1795 opera ''The Wicklow Mountains'', written by [[John O'Keeffe (Irish writer)|John O'Keeffe]] with music by [[William Shield]].  ===Claimed 13th or 16th century origins===  These suggestions originated with [[Joseph Cooper Walker]], who said in his ''Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards'' (1786) that the air's title in fact referred to what he called the "coulins", or long locks of hair, worn by Irish men and which were prohibited by a statute of [[Henry VIII]], although he noted that no actual words to the air on this subject had survived.<ref name=walker134>Walker, J. C. ''Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards'', Payne, 1786, p.134</ref> Despite the lack of a text, Walker's assertion was repeated by, amongst others, [[Laurence F. Renehan|Renehan]] and [[W. H. Grattan Flood]]: Flood however proposed (based on a suggestion by Lynch in a letter to the ''Dublin Penny Journal'') the air must refer to an earlier statute of the 13th century. The story inspired a 19th-century patriotic poem called ''The Coulin Forbidden'', written by W. B. McBurney under the pseudonym "Carroll Malone".  [[File:Eugene OCurry-Social England 1904-p889-with-header.jpg|thumbnail|right|The distinguished philologist [[Eugene O'Curry]] believed that the air known as The Coolin was first given that name in the early 18th century by a Fr. Oliver O'Hanley.]]  The philologist [[Eugene O'Curry]] asserted, however, that the title "The Coolin" was only applied to the air in the 18th century after it was used by a priest, Fr. Oliver O'Hanley, to set a poem he wrote in praise of a famous beauty of [[County Limerick]].<ref name=griffin>O'Curry, E. Note XXVI to Griffin, G. ''The Invasion'', 1895, p.586</ref> In this case, O'Curry commented, the word "Coolin" is used in its sense "fair-haired one", to refer to a girl: he disagrees with Walker, stating "no such word was ever, or ever could have been, applied to the ''glibbs'', or long tufts of back hair, prohibited by old English statute".<ref name="griffin"/>  The Rev. L. Donnellan, in a survey of the various texts and tunes of The Coolin, published in the 1912 ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', was equally dismissive: he states that Walker's "credulous" story of it referring to an English statute was "fabricated by his friend [William] Beauford".<ref name=donnellan1112>Donnellan, L. "Traditional Irish and Highland Airs", in Quinn (ed.), ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', vol 3, no. 1 (1912), 11-12</ref> He also notes that what he called Walker's "foolish speculation" was encouraged by his insertion of the phrase "glibbs and coulins" into the 16th century statute, which he notes only refers to proscribed "glibbs".<ref name="donnellan1112"/> Donnellan's conclusion was that the original composition was a 17th-century one attributed to O Duagain (see below).  ===Text attributed to O Duagain===  The oldest and best-known Irish text definitely associated with the tune is a love-poem addressed to a fair-haired girl (''chúilfhionn''); this is attributed to a poet called Muiris O Duagain or Maurice O'Dugan of [[Benburb]] and said to have been written in around 1641.<ref name=hardiman>Hardiman, James. ''Irish minstrelsy, or Bardic remains of Ireland'', v.1, 1831, p.349</ref> English translations of this text have been written by Sir [[Samuel Ferguson]] (beginning "O have you seen the Coolun") and [[Thomas Furlong (poet)|Thomas Furlong]], amongst others. The latter was printed by [[James Hardiman]], along with O Duagain's original text, in his collection ''Irish Minstrelsy'' (1831).  A version of O Duagain of Benburb's poem was also printed, with translations, in [[Douglas Hyde]]'s ''Love Songs of Connacht'' (1893), with the first line ''A's éirigh do shuidhe a bhuachaill a's gleus dam mo ghearrán'' ("And rise up lad, and get ready for me my nag"). Hyde omits two stanzas already printed by Hardiman, and describes this as a version collected in [[Connacht]].<ref name=hyde>Hyde, ''Love Songs of Connacht'', 1893, pp.69-70</ref>  Donnellan, after dismissing Walker, Grattan Flood and O'Curry's other suggestions, states that the probability "is that O'Dugan of Benburb did compose a poem with this air perhaps substantially the same as the different versions given by Hardiman, Vol. I., p. 251 ; O'Daly, p. 155 ; and Dr. Hyde, pp. 70-73 in the ''Love Songs of Connacht''".<ref name="donnellan1112"/>   ===Text attributed to O'Hanley===  Writing in the early 1800s, O'Curry said that the title "The Coolin" was first applied to the air in the 18th century after it was used by a poet, Father Oliver O'Hanley (fl. 1700-1750), to set an Irish-language poem he had written in praise of Nelly O'Grady, a celebrated beauty of [[County Limerick]].<ref name="griffin"/> This text, beginning ''Ceó meala lá seaca, ar choilltibh dubha baraighe'' ("A honey mist on a day of frost, in a dark oak wood"), and which is addressed to ''Neilidh'' ("Nelly") was printed by Hyde, who said it was written in a manuscript originating in [[County Clare]], though the manuscript was partly damaged and he could not read two stanzas.<ref name="hyde"/>  ===Other texts===  Hyde noted the existence of what he called a Munster version of the poem, given in O'Daly's ''The poets and poetry of Munster'' (1850).<ref name="hyde"/> This shares some material with that attributed to O Duagain, but is only three stanzas long and includes a reference to a member of the Power family.<ref name=odaly>O'Daly, J. ''The Poets and Poetry of Munster: A Selection of Irish Songs by the Poets of the Last Century'', 1850, pp.124-125</ref>  Another well-known text was written for the air in English by the poet [[Thomas Moore]], usually known by its first line ''Though the last glimpse of Erin''. It is not a translation of any of the earlier Irish versions. Donnellan noted that the version of the air used by Moore was substantially "correct and unaltered", particularly in comparison to Bunting's, when compared with early 19th and late 18th century copies of the tune, though it still showed some evidence of having been adapted by an "instrumentalist".<ref name=donnellan12>Donnellan, 12, 13</ref>  ==Text==  The following is the early 19th century translation of O Duagain's text by Ferguson:  :O have you seen the Coolun, :Walking down the cuckoo's street, :With the dew of the meadow shining :On her milk-white twinkling feet! :My love she is, and my ''coleen oge'', :And she dwells in Bal'nagar; :And she bears the palm of beauty bright, :From the fairest that in Erin are.  :In Bal'nagar is the Coolun :Like the berry on the bough her cheek; :Bright beauty dwells for ever :On her fair neck and ringlets sleek; :Oh, sweeter is her mouth's soft music :Than the lark or thrush at dawn, :Or the blackbird in the greenwood singing :Farewell to the setting sun.  :Rise up, my boy! make ready :My horse, for I forth would ride, :To follow the modest damsel, :Where she walks on the green hillside; :Where since our youth were we plighted, :In faith, troth, and wedlock true - :She is sweeter to me nine times over, :Than organ or cuckoo!  :For, ever since my childhood :I loved the fair and darling child; :But our people came between us, :And with lucre our pure love defiled; :Ah, my woe it is, and my bitter pain, :And I weep it night and day, :That the ''coleen bawn'' of my early love, :Is torn from my heart away.  :Sweetheart and faithful treasure, :Be constant still and true; :Nor for want of herds and houses :Leave one who would ne'er leave you, :I'll pledge you the blessed Bible, :Without and eke within, :That the faithful God will provide for us, :Without thanks to kith or kin.   :Oh, love, do you remember :When we lay all night alone, :Beneath the ash in the winter storm :When the oak wood round did groan? :No shelter then from the blast had we, :The bitter blast or sleet, :But your gown to wrap about our heads, :And my coat around our feet.<ref name=ferguson>''The Book of Irish Ballads: Edited by Denis Florence M'Carthy'', James Duffy, 1846, p.188</ref>  ==Historic performances==  The Coolin was a popular part of the Irish harp repertoire of the 18th century. [[Charles Fanning (harper)|Charles Fanning]] won first prize at the [[Belfast Harp Festival]] of 1792 with a performance of The Coolin, repeating his success at the earlier [[Granard]] harp festivals with the same tune.<ref name=aoneill>[http://billhaneman.ie/AIH/MemoirsOfArthurONeill.html The Memoirs of Arthur O'Neill], Chapter XVI</ref> Bunting appears to have disapproved of Fanning's performance at Belfast, noting that he "was not the best performer, but he succeeded in getting the first prize by playing 'The Coolin' with modern variations, a piece of music at the time much in request by young practitioners on the piano-forte".<ref name=oneill>Bunting, quoted in O'Neill, F. ''Irish Minstrels and Musicians'', 1913, p.84</ref>  After the decline of Irish harping in the early 19th century, the air became equally popular as an instrumental piece with fiddle players and [[uilleann pipes|pipers]]. Recordings of The Coolin exist by [[Leo Rowsome]], [[Johnny Doran]] and [[Willie Clancy (musician)|Willie Clancy]], amongst others.  ==Samuel Barber setting==  The composer [[Samuel Barber]] published a setting of The Coolin in 1942 for unaccompanied chorus, based on a text originally published by [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] in the collection ''Reincarnations''.<ref name=heyman182>Heyman, B. ''Samuel Barber'', OUP, 1992, p.182</ref> Stephens said that his poem, "The Coolun", was based on another by "[[Antoine Ó Raifteiri|Raftery]]",<ref name=stephens>Stephens, ''Reincarnations'', Macmillan, 1918</ref> but seems to bear some similarity to parts of the O'Hanley text ''Ceó meala lá seaca, ar choilltibh dubha baraighe''.  ==References==  {{reflist}}  [[Category:Irish songs]] [[Category:Year of song unknown]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Coolin}}</text></page>",

"<page><title>Camaldolese Church, Warsaw</title><text>'''Camaldolese Church''', dating from the 17th-18th centuries and situated among the buildings of the hermitage in the Bielański Forest, is one of the most beautiful baroque churches in [[Warsaw]].  [[File:Church of Camaldoleses in Warsaw.JPG|thumb|Camaldolese Church, Warsaw]] <big>'''History'''</big>  The king of Poland [[Władysław IV Vasa]] (Polish: Władysław IV Waza) founded the first church in Bielański Forest as a vote of gratitude for royal election the crown and wining in the Smolensk campaign. The church had to be situated in a remote area according to the [[Camaldolese]]s tradition and it was built on the area of former village Pólko (now Bielany). In 1669-1710 and 1733-1755 the church was rebuilt, the founders of the project were Polish kings [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] (Polish: Jan II Kazimierz Waza) and [[Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki|Michael I]] (Polish: Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki).  During the 19th century Poland was under partitions. After the fall of the [[January Uprising]] in 1864, Tsarist occupation authorities liquidated all Camaldoles monasteries with the exception of the Warsaw. In the next years Russian authorities took over some of the buildings. The Russian introduced a ban on the admission of new members. After that the church and hermitages were taken over by the Russian Red Cross.  In 1905 there was created a parish and the church was renovated. After Russians withdrawal from Warsaw in 1914 there was form an orphanage run by Sisters. In 1916 seminar was launched and in 1918 there was created junior high school. For the purposes it was erected a new building placed in the former foresterium. Nowadays the church and the hermitage huts are preserved in original state. After the destructions of the 2nd World War and burning down of the gymnasium building the former monastery buildings were redesigned by the ATK (Catholic Theology Academy), now UKSW (Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University), and in the site of the hostelry and the remnants of the gymnasium building there is a modern seminary building being erected by the Warsaw Archdiocese.  <big>'''Architecture'''</big><br /> [[File:Plan of the Church of Camaldoleses in Warsaw.jpg|thumb|Plan of the Camaldolese Church, Warsaw]]  Standing in front of the facade of the church we are exactly on the axis of the monastic complex. It is point out by the wooden cross standing at today Dewajtis street. From the setting of that cross in 1693 began to pave the grounds of the monastery. The monastery complex consists of a gate, church, 13 hermitages and foresterium. According to Mariusz Karpowicz the church was designed by Italian architect Isidoro Affaitati.  '''''Facade'''''  Facade was erected when the church with the main body had been already built. Designer of that late Baroque works could be a Roman architect [[Gaetano Chiaveri]]. The facade is triaxle - the central part is a little forward of and topped with a tympanum, enclosed in a pair of composite pilasters and columns. We can observe here two architectural styles late Baroque and early Classicism. The first of them we can see in the details and the second one in the central part and columns. In the side niches are set two wooden polychrome sculptures. The first shows [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]] and the second one [[Romuald|Saint Romuald]].  '''''Interior'''''  Interior decorations are in rococo style. the church has an octagonal plan cut by cross. Presbytery is a double span, closed semicircular. There is an octagonal nave, which cut transept by transverse axis. The transept is made by two symmetrical chapels. We can observe a great sailing vault. On the diagonal axes are four chapels lower than those which determine presbytery. Consistency adds fact that whole interior has part of Corinthian style for example columns. Between the chapels there are placed narrow passages.  '''''Hermitages'''''<br /> [[File:Gate to hermitages - Church of Camaldoleses in Warsaw.JPG|thumb|Hermitage Gate, Camaldolese Church, Warsaw]] Walking around the church, we can see 13 [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitages]]. They are arranged in four parallel rows on either side of the central axis formed. Between houses connected by low walls fences are situated gardens. All hermitages have the same interior. In the center there is cross-vaulted hall, on the one side there is a cell and small utility room, on the other side we can see chapel and woodshed.  <big>'''Nowadays'''</big>  At present near the church there is junior high school, high school and UKSW (Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University). Now the church is also a kind of cultural center. The concerts and theatrical performances take place in the crypt, there is also a café. There are several attractions for children such as wooden carousel and a donkey. The church is attractive both for local society and tourists.  <big>'''Bibliography:'''</big> * Maria Brykowska, Kościół Kamedułów na Bielanach, Warszawa: Wyd. PWN, 1982  * Ks.

Set in a [[quarantine]]d [[Boston]] office building, the episode revolves around a thousands-year-old [[virus]] that infects and then influences its victims to attempt to spread the contagion outside of the building.  It was the third ''Fringe'' episode to be written by supervising producer [[Jeff Vlaming]], while it was director [[Deran Sarafian]]'s only credit for the series to date. After his character becomes infected, actor [[Joshua Jackson]] commented during shooting to "just imagine the worst hangover I've ever had and multiply it by ten".<ref name=analyze/>  "What Lies Below" first aired in the United States on January 21, 2010 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]. An estimated 6.90 million viewers watched the episode, and it received mixed reviews from critics, with one calling it average and predictable.<ref name=ignreview/>  ==Plot== In [[Boston]], a visibly sick man from the [[Netherlands]] arrives at an office building, only to collapse and die. The veins in his body erupt with blood, spraying surrounding witnesses. The Fringe team arrive on site, and while interviewing the witnesses, another man also becomes sick. The sick man attempts to leave the building, only to be stopped by [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] ([[John Noble]]), who sees the man spray out blood and realizes there is a [[Infectious disease|contagion]]. The building is [[Quarantine|quarantined]] with Walter's son [[Peter Bishop|Peter]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]), FBI agent [[Olivia Dunham|Olivia]] ([[Anna Torv]]), and the rest of the witnesses still inside.  The [[Center for Disease Control|CDC]] arrives and soon clash with Walter, who wants some blood samples to take back to his lab at [[Harvard]]. As another witness, the receptionist, falls ill, the rest begin panicking that the virus is an airborne contagion. Olivia discovers that the Dutch man was an oil consultant who arrived to meet with Mr. Ames, one of the other office workers trapped in the building.  Walter explains that viruses have forms of "personalities," that influence their hosts to act in certain ways. He posits that the virus is not airborne after all, but needs more samples for further tests. Meanwhile the infected receptionist is influenced by the virus, jumps out a window, and also scares Peter into falling into an infected pool of blood. The woman is sprayed with decontaminate spray, as Peter quickly rinses himself off. Knowing he is likely infected, Peter searches through the Dutch man's pockets, leading to the discovery of a briefcase infected by the virus.  Walter continues his theory that the virus wants to escape the building, hence the multiple escape attempts by the infected. The virus was found on a sample taken 10 miles below the earth, and may be 75,000 years old and responsible for wiping out the [[Ice Age]] [[mammals]]. As a [[bio-hazard]] team enters the building to test people for the virus, a CDC official orders the army to prepare for a "level six eradication", because they still do not know how to contain it.  Peter manages to fake the test and hide his infection. He and Olivia begin leading a team of healthy people outside the building, but before Peter is able to leave, his nose bleeds, clearly revealing that he is infected. While the virus overtakes Peter's health and sanity, Walter becomes increasingly distressed as he fears losing his son again, and accidentally blurts out that he "can't let Peter die again" to [[Astrid Farnsworth|Astrid]] ([[Jasika Nicole]]). Despite the threat of eradication and death, he and Astrid remain in the building to run further tests on the Dutch man. Walter realizes that [[sulfuric]] ash killed the virus thousands of years ago, and successfully finds a cure with some [[horseradish]] he found in the office break room.  The CDC agrees to allow Olivia to enter the building and use the air ventilation system to spread some fentanyl gas, which will gain them time while the cure is synthesized. While inside, Peter attacks her, but Olivia is able to turn the air on, successfully knocking out the building's occupants. Peter and everyone else are successfully cured. Astrid later approaches Walter and asks what he meant when he said he couldn't let Peter die again, to which he responds by saying "some things are meant to be left alone."  ==Production== [[File:Fringe Panel 3 2010 CC.jpg|right|thumb|[[Peter Bishop]], played by actor [[Joshua Jackson]] ''(pictured left)'' becomes infected with an ancient virus in the episode.]]  Supervising producer [[Jeff Vlaming]] wrote "What Lies Below",<ref name=mtvreview/> his second episode of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/jeff-vlaming/credits/243586 |title=Jeff Vlaming: Credits |last= |first=|work=[[TV Guide]] |date=|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> Filmmaker [[Deran Sarafian]] served as the director,<ref name=sfscope>{{cite web|url=http://sfscope.com/2010/01/black-oil-reduxfringes-what-li.html |title=Black Oil Redux—Fringe's "What Lies Beneath"|last=Stegall |first=Sarah |publisher=[[SFScope]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> his first and only ''Fringe'' directional credit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/deran-sarafian/credits/188874 |title=Deran Sarafian: Credits |last= |first=|work=[[TV Guide]] |date=|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> The episode featured one-time guest appearances by actors [[Demore Barnes]], [[Geoff Pierson]], [[Conrad Coates]], [[Natassia Malthe]], and [[David Richmond-Peck]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/fringe-2010/episode-13-season-2/lies/293813 |title=Fringe Episode: "What Lies Below" |last=|first=|work=[[TV Guide]] |date=|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> Actor [[Joshua Jackson]], who plays an infected [[Peter Bishop]] in the episode, noted during shooting that he found inspiration from "imagin[ing] the worst hangover I've ever had and multiply it by ten".<ref name=analyze>{{cite video |people=[[Anna Torv]], [[Joshua Jackson]], [[Deran Sarafian]], Michael Mitchell, Bob Comer, Angela Uyeda |date=2010 |title=Analyzing the Scene for "What Lies Below"| medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] Television |location=''Fringe: The Complete Second Season'' Disc 3 }}</ref>   Actress [[Jasika Nicole]] was pleased that the writers decided to let her character discover Walter's secret, commenting "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I think that it was really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has to step up to the plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution.

To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above the van and asked to jump onto the van below. The crew removed the roof structure on the van, and carefully rigged it to cave-in upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter glass plate that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance she jumped.<ref name=analyze/>  ==Reception== ===Ratings=== The first airing of "What Lies Below" was watched by an estimated 6.90 million viewers in the United States, with a 2.6/7 rating for those aged 18–49.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/22/tv-ratings-thursday-deep-end-underwater-bones-annual-high-csi-mentalist-greys-series-lows/39739/|title=TV Ratings Thursday: ''Deep End'' Underwater; ''Bones'' High; ''CSI'', ''Mentalist'', ''Grey's'' Series Lows|last=Gorman|first=Bill|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> [[SFScope]] writer Sarah Stegall considered these numbers to be "steady but stagnant ratings", as they were "not much different" from the [[Johari Window (Fringe)|previous week]].<ref name=sfscope/>  ===Reviews=== "What Lies Below" received mixed reviews from television critics. ''[[The A.V.

Facing international sanctions, the Syrian government relied on criminal organizations to smuggle goods and money in and out of the country. The economic downturn caused by the conflict and sanctions also led to lower wages for Shabiha members. In response, some Shabiha members began stealing civilian properties, and engaging in kidnappings.<ref name="Organized crime" />  Rebel forces sometimes relied on criminal networks to obtain weapons and supplies. Black market weapon prices in Syria's neighboring countries have significantly increased since the start of the conflict.

(1910–1990) was widely recognized by the engineering community and known for his innovative [[structural engineering]] solutions, as a senior assistant engineer and [[lieutenant]] with the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defense]], a professor at the [[University of Toronto]], as co-founder of the North American firm [[Morrison Hershfield]], and as a prolific author. He was a lifelong advocate of education and the engineering profession.  ==Early life and education==  Hershfield' parents Aaron and Molly Hershfield left Teofipol, [[Ukraine]] in the mid-1890s for [[Manitoba, Canada]] in search of greater opportunities and in the hopes of starting a family. On December 24, 1910 their son Charles Hershfield was born. As a child and later in his teens, Hershfield's interests resided in music, [[baseball]], [[carpentry]], and [[mechanical engineering]]. He attended St. John’s High School in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, and even from a young age, highly valued his education.  Hershfield later studied engineering at the [[University of Manitoba]]. Working with two of his classmates, H.F. Peters and W. Gruber, Hershfield submitted the thesis “Some Tests of Welded Joints”. Hershfield graduated in 1930 with the degree of [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[civil engineering]].   During the summer periods as an undergraduate Hershfield worked for the [[Dominion Bridge Company]] in Winnipeg. Upon graduation and until 1932, in conjunction with the Winnipeg City Engineer, he was involved with structural design of bridges, viaducts and subways.  Several years later Hershfield continued his education and received the degree of [[Master of Applied Science]] from the University of Toronto in 1950. His master’s thesis was titled “Series Expansion of Joint Rotations for the Analysis of Rigidly Framed Structures “.<ref name="Engineering Journal" />  ==Working life==  In 1935 Hershfield moved to [[Toronto, Ontario]] and until 1941 was employed with Standard Iron and Steel Works where his skills and services were focused in [[structural design]], estimating, contracting, detailing and supervision of the fabrication and erection of steel structures.  From 1941 to 1943 he was a staff member of the [[Canadian Department of National Defense]], Naval Service, Works and Building Branch as Senior Assistant Engineer, with the rank of Lieutenant. His work during this time included structural design on naval shore establishments including shops, storage facilities, training buildings, and drill halls, of wide variety as to size and materials of construction.<ref name="Engineering Journal" />  After leaving the naval service in 1943, Hershfield joined the staff of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Toronto. Hershfield taught a variety of courses related to structural engineering and supervised many graduate students. He was also principal instructor in structural engineering in the [[School of Architecture]] at University of Toronto.<ref>“OAA Periodical: Charles Hershfield P.Eng.’’. (March/April 1982). Ontario Association of Architects, p. 5.</ref>  In 1946 Hershfield, along with [[Carson Morrison]], Joe Millman, and Mark Huggins, responded to the post-war building boom by founding the engineering consulting firm Morrison Hershfield Millman and Huggins. The firm today exists under the name [[Morrison Hershfield]], with offices across North America specializing in multidisciplinary engineering and related expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morrisonhershfield.com/aboutus/Pages/OurHistory.aspx|title=Morrison Hershfield History|publisher=Morrison Hershfield|accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref>   Hershfield retired from teaching at the University of Toronto in 1976 after 31 years of service but continued to work closely with Morrison Hershfield almost up to the time of his death.  ==Notable projects== * Assisted with complex structural design of the roof for the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] Theatre, [[Stratford, Ontario]] (1957)<ref name="Engineers Honored" /> * Designed the complex structural roofing system for the Ontario Pavilion Building at [[Expo 67]], Montreal, Quebec (1967)<ref name="Engineers Honored" /> * Assisted with the expansion of the Toronto [[Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto|Mount Sinai Hospital]], Toronto, [[Ontario]]<ref name="Engineers Honored" /> * University of Toronto Medical Science Building, Toronto, Ontario  ==Awards and achievements== * Elected to the grade of Partner with the Engineering Institute of Canada, 1955. * Member of the Publications Committee, for the Engineering Journal, 1970–74. * Elected to [[EIC Fellow|Fellow]] of the [[Engineering Institute of Canada]], 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eic-ici.ca/fellows.html |title=EIC Fellows |publisher=[[Engineering Institute of Canada]] |accessdate={{Format date|2011|2|23}}}}</ref> * Consulting Engineer Designation, [[Association of Professional Engineers]], 1974. * Member of the Committee of Examiners, Ontario Association of Architects, 1974–82 * Member of the [[Canadian Standards Association]] Standards Policy Board, 1977–78. * Requalifed as a Designated Consulting Engineer, Association of Professional Engineers, 1979. * Awarded the Engineering Medal by the Association of [[Professional Engineers Ontario]], 1982.<ref name="Engineering for People" /> * Served as a Structural Engineer on the OAA Committee of Examiners, 1982. * Upon his death, the University of Toronto set up the Charles Hershfield Memorial Scholarship fund to acknowledge Hershfield's significant accomplishments as a structural engineer and professor.

"<page><title>Charles Fairfax (antiquary)</title><text>'''Charles Fairfax''' (1597–1673) was an English antiquary and genealogist.  ==Early life== Fairfax was born at [[Denton, Yorkshire]] on 5 March 1597, and was the seventh and third surviving son of [[Thomas Fairfax, 1st Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas (afterwards first Lord) Fairfax]]. His two surviving brothers (four others were killed fighting in 1631) were [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando]] and [[Henry Fairfax (academic)| Henry]]. He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] on 5 October 1611,<ref>{{acad|id= FRFS611C|name=Fairfax, Charles}}</ref> and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 9 March 1618. About 1627 he married Mary, sole heiress of the Breary family, of [[Scough Hall]] in the forest of Knaresborough and Menston.  The counsellor and annalist of his family, the rest of his life was spent mainly on his family tree, at [[Menston]], Yorkshire.  At Menston he was within a few miles of his paternal home at Denton. <ref name=dnb/>  ==Civil war== A few days before the [[battle of Marston Moor]] (2 July 1644) Cromwell and other parliamentary leaders held a conference at Fairfax's house at Menston around a table now at [[Farnley Hall, Yorkshire]]. While his nephew, [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas]], afterwards the third Lord Fairfax, did much to preserve the minster and archives at York, Charles was engaged with another antiquary, [[Roger Dodsworth]], in the search for and rescue of books and documents. In 1646 he was appointed by his brother, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando]], the second Lord Fairfax, as steward of the courts at [[Ripon]], and during the later years of the Commonwealth was induced to take service as a Colonel of Foot, a position which he held in [[George Monck]]'s army in Scotland at the time of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660. During Monck's march into Yorkshire he was appointed governor of the town of [[Kingston-upon-Hull]]. This office he held only about a year and then retired to Menston with a pension, granted him by Charles II out of the customs at Hull. <ref name=dnb/>  ==Death and family== He died in Menston in December 1673. The registers of Fewston parish church record his burial, and also that of his wife in 1657; they were both buried in the Fairfax transept of the parish church at [[Otley]], where there was a mural monument to their memory. Among his children were twin brothers, John, a captain in the army, and [[Henry Fairfax (dean)|Henry]], a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and dean of Norwich, who were so alike as to be indistinguishable by their own mother. <ref name=dnb/>  ==Written work and collections== Fairfax wrote a work in manuscript entitled ''Analecta Fairfaxiana''. It contains pedigrees, carefully written and blazoned on vellum, of all the branches of the Fairfax family, and of many of the families connected with it, interspersed with many genealogical and literary notes, and about fifty anagrams, epigrams, and elegies in Latin. <ref name=dnb/> It went to [[Leeds Castle, Kent]] and then  passed into the library of  Sir [[Thomas Phillipps]]. Along with several related volumes, tt was acquired by Leeds University Library in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb206brothertoncollectionmsyks2|title=Analecta Fairfaxiana|publisher=Archives Hub|accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref>  By his will, dated 1672, Fairfax bequeathed manuscripts to [[Lincoln's Inn]].<ref name=dnb>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fairfax, Charles}}</ref>  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{DNB|wstitle=Fairfax, Charles}} {{onesource|date=February 2011}}  {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME              = Fairfax, Charles | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = English antiquary | DATE OF BIRTH     = 1597 | PLACE OF BIRTH    = | DATE OF DEATH     = 1673 | PLACE OF DEATH    = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Fairfax, Charles}} [[Category:1597 births]] [[Category:1673 deaths]] [[Category:People from Yorkshire]] [[Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge]] [[Category:Roundheads]] [[Category:17th-century English writers]] [[Category:English antiquarians]] [[Category:English genealogists]] [[Category:Fairfax family|Charles]] [[Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn]] [[Category:17th-century antiquarians]]</text></page>",

But as more developments of Punggol 21 were progressively unveiled, the station was opened with the rest of the line in 2003. In 2005, a middle platform was built on the LRT Platform for services to Punggol North but plans for that were aborted and the platform was replaced with walkways.  ==Station layout== {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style="border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" rowspan=5 valign=top|'''L2<br>Platform''' |style="border-top:solid 1px gray;"|Platform 1 |style="border-top:solid 1px gray;" colspan=2|<small> <span style=color:black>{{SLRT lines|Punggol}}: Route A: West Loop Outer towards {{SLRT code|PT|C}}<span style="color:black;"> Punggol</span> via [[Soo Teck LRT Station|Soo Teck]] (after 3pm Daily) (→)</span><br />{{SLRT lines|Punggol}}: Route D: East Loop Inner towards {{SLRT code|PT|C}} Punggol via [[Cove LRT Station|Cove]] (→)</small> |- |style="border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px grey;" colspan=2 align=center|<small>[[Island platform]], doors will open on the right</small> |- |colspan="2"|<span style=color:grey><center>Future trackway reserved for Punggol North Line (covered by granite slabs)</center></span> |- |style="border-top:solid 2px grey;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;" colspan=2 align=center|<small>[[Island platform]], doors will open on the right</small> |- |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;"|Platform 2 |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" colspan=2|<small><span style=color:black>{{SLRT lines|Punggol}}: Route B: West Loop Inner towards {{SLRT code|PT|C}}<span style="color:black;"> Punggol</span> via [[Sam Kee LRT Station|Sam Kee]] (until 3pm Daily) (←)</span><br /> {{SLRT lines|Punggol}}: Route C: East Loop Outer towards {{SLRT code|PT|C}} Punggol via [[Damai LRT Station, Singapore|Damai]] (←)</small> |- |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=50 valign=top|'''L1''' |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=100 valign=top|Main Lobby |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=550 valign=top|Faregates, Ticketing Machines, Passenger Service Centre, [[Punggol Bus Interchange]], [[Waterway Point]] (U/C). |- |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=50 valign=top|'''B1''' |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=100 valign=top|Service Level |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" width=550 valign=top|Restricted Access |- |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;" rowspan=3 valign=top|'''B2<br>Platform''' |Platform A |{{SMRT lines|North East}} <small> towards [[HarbourFront MRT Station|{{SMRT code 2I/C|NE|1|CC|29}} HarbourFront]] via {{SMRT-SLRT code 2I/C|NE|16|ST|C}} {{SMRT stations|station=Sengkang}} (→) </small> |- |style="border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;" colspan=2 align=center|<small>[[Island platform]], doors will open on the left, right</small> |- |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;"|Platform B |style="border-bottom:solid 1px gray;"|{{SMRT lines|North East}} <small> towards [[HarbourFront MRT Station|{{SMRT code 2I/C|NE|1|CC|29}} HarbourFront]] via {{SMRT-SLRT code 2I/C|NE|16|ST|C}} {{SMRT stations|station=Sengkang}} (→) </small> |}  ==Transport connections== ===Rail=== {| style="text-align:centre; font-size:95%; border:1px solid black" |- !

The team plays [[Oxford University RFC]] in the annual [[The Varsity Match|Varsity Match]] at [[Twickenham Stadium]] every December.   Cambridge players wear light blue and white hooped jerseys with a red lion crest. Many have gone on to represent their country and the [[British and Irish Lions]]; a few, most notably [[Daniel Vickerman|Dan Vickerman]], have represented Cambridge after successful international careers. Whilst at Cambridge University [[James Bevan]] became the first captain of the [[Wales national rugby union team]].  == History == Football is believed to have been introduced to Cambridge University in 1839 by [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] fresher [[Albert Pell]].<ref name="Marshall13">Marshall (1951), pg 13.</ref> Pell had matriculated to Cambridge from [[Rugby School]], where the game of rugby is believed to have originated. Cambridge University Rugby Union Football Club was officially established in 1872, around three years after the Oxford rugby club was founded. The first Varsity match was contested between the two teams on 10 February 1872.<ref name="Marshall17">Marshall (1951), pg 17.</ref> The Cambridge team was led out by captain [[Isaac Cowley Lambert]], wearing pink jerseys with a monogram on the left breast.<ref name="Marshall17"/> Played away at the Park in Oxford, Cambridge lost by a single goal to nil. CURUFC officials helped to draw up the laws of the game that were adopted by the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) when it was established in 1871. Cambridge became a Constituent Body of the Union in 1872, a status which the club still holds today. In [[1873-74 Home Nations rugby union matches|1874]], Cambridge provided their first international player directly from the club, when [[John Batten]] represented [[England national rugby union team|England]] in the third encounter against [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]].

The Flyers lost in the second round of the playoffs to the [[New Jersey Devils]] in five games.  ==Off-season== Following his penchant for making big moves, Flyers General Manager [[Paul Holmgren]] pulled off perhaps the most stunning move of his tenure, trading captain [[Mike Richards]] to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] for [[Brayden Schenn]], [[Wayne Simmonds]] and a 2012 second-round draft pick, as well as [[Jeff Carter]] to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] for their 2011 first-round pick ([[Sean Couturier]]) and [[Jakub Voráček|Jakub Voracek]], all within the span of an hour on June 23. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]]' [[Ilya Bryzgalov]] to a nine-year, $51 million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed [[Jaromír Jágr|Jaromir Jagr]] to a one-year contract, [[Maxime Talbot]] to a five-year contract and [[Andreas Lilja]] to a two-year contract.  ==Regular season== [[Chris Pronger]] was named the Flyers' captain;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=588692 |title=Pronger Named Captain |publisher=Philadelphia Flyers |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=December 20, 2014}}</ref> however, 13 games into the season, he was lost for the remainder of the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome.  Bryzgalov's play ranged from spectacular to subpar, including being benched in favor of [[Sergei Bobrovsky]] for the Flyers' 3–2 loss to the [[New York Rangers]] in the [[2012 NHL Winter Classic|2012 Winter Classic]]. Twelve rookies suited up for the Flyers during the season, with the play of Sean Couturier, Brayden Schenn and [[Matt Read]] standing out impressively.  The Flyers concluded the regular season with the most powerplay opportunities of all teams (335), the most powerplay goals scored (66) and the most powerplay opportunities against (319).<ref>http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2012.html</ref>  ===Season standings=== {{2011–12 NHL Atlantic Division standings|team=PHI}} {{2011–12 NHL Eastern Conference standings|team=PHI}}  ==Playoffs== The Flyers drew the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the first round of the [[2012 Stanley Cup Playoffs|playoffs]], a series in which the two teams combined for an NHL-record 45 goals in the first four games and a total of 309 penalty minutes in an intense, fight-filled series. The Flyers pulled off the upset in six games against a Pittsburgh team that was heavily favored to win the [[Stanley Cup]]. But in the second round against the [[New Jersey Devils]], the Flyers' run-and-gun style of play was stymied by the Devils' forechecking and defense, and the Flyers were eliminated in five games.  ==Schedule and results==  ===Pre-season=== {| class="toccolours"  style="width:100%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;" |- ! colspan="2" style="background:#fff; border-top:#F4793E 5px solid; border-bottom:#000 5px solid;"| 2011 pre-season<ref>{{cite web|title=2011-2012 Preseason Schedule/Results - Philadelphia Flyers - Schedule|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/schedule.htm?season=20112012&gameType=1|publisher=''Philadelphia Flyers''}}</ref>  |- valign="top" |<div class="NavFrame"> <div class="NavHead" style="background:#fff; border-top:#F4793E 2px solid; border-bottom:#000 2px solid;">Pre-season: 4–2–1 (Home: 2–1–1; Road: 2–1–0)</div> <div class="NavContent" style="display:none;"> {| class="wikitable" style="width:100%;" |- bgcolor="#dddddd" !

"<page><title>Feeding disorder</title><text>A '''feeding disorder'''  in infancy or early childhood is a child's refusal to eat certain food groups, textures, solids or liquids for a period of at least one month, which causes them to not gain enough weight or grow naturally.<ref name="minddisorder.com"/> Feeding disorders resemble [[failure to thrive]], except that in feeding disorder there is no medical or physiological condition that can explain the very small amount of food the children consume or their lack of growth.<ref name="minddisorder.com">{{cite web|title=Feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Del-Fi/Feeding-disorder-of-infancy-or-early-childhood.html|work=Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref>  ==Symptoms== Children attempting to swallow different food textures often vomit, gag, or choke while eating. At feeding times they may react negatively to attempts to feed them, and refuse to eat.<ref name=KKlod>{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorders|url=http://www.kennedykrieger.org/kki_diag.jsp?pid=1084|publisher=Kennedy Krieger Institute|accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref>  Other symptoms include difficulty in chewing or vomiting and spitting whilst eating. Many children may have feeding difficulties and may be picky eaters, but most of them still have a fairly healthy diet. Children with a feeding disorder however, will completely abandon some of the food groups, textures, or liquids that are necessary for human growth and development.  Children with this disorder can develop much more slowly and can also experience behavioral problems. In severe cases the child seems to feel socially isolated.<ref name=KKlod/>  ==Types== Feeding disorder has been divided into six further sub-types:<ref name=Sexon>{{cite book|last=Sexson|first=Sandra B.|title=Child and adolescent psychiatry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-1768-0|pages=399}}</ref>  # Feeding disorder of state regulation # Feeding disorder of reciprocity (neglect)''' # Infantile [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] # Sensory food aversion # Feeding disorder associated with concurrent medical condition # Post-traumatic feeding disorder  ==Associated problems== A few of the medical and psychological conditions that have been known to be associated with this disorder include:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kennedykrieger.org/patient-care/diagnoses-disorders/feeding-disorders | title=Feeding Disorders | publisher=Kennedy Krieger Institute | date=2012 | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> *Gastrointestinal motility disorders  *Oral-motor dysfunction  *Failure to thrive  *Prematurity  *Food allergies *Behavior management issues *Sensory Problems  A child that is suffering from malnutrition can have permanently stunted mental and physical development. Getting treatment early is essential and can prevent many of the complications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorders|url=http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/001540trt.htm|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> They can also develop further eating disorders later in life such as [[anorexia nervosa]], or they could become a limited eater—though they could still be a healthy child they may become a picky eater.  ==Diagnosis== A barium swallow test is often performed, where the child is given a liquid or food with barium in it. This allows the consulting medical practitioners to trace the swallow-function on an x ray or other investigative system such as a [[X-ray computed tomography|CATScan]]. An endoscopic assignment test can also be performed, where an endoscope is used to view the oesophagus and throat on a screen. It can also allow viewing of how the patient will react during feeding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorders and swallowing disorders|url= http://www.asha.org/public/speech/swallowing/feedswallowchildren.htm|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>  ==Treatments== There is no quick cure, and treatment will be based on what problems may be causing the feeding disorder. Depending on the condition, the following steps can be taken: increasing the number of foods that are accepted, increasing the amount of calories and the amount of fluids; checks for vitamin or mineral deficiencies; finding out what the illnesses or psychosocial problems are. To accomplish these goals patients may have to be hospitalized for extensive periods of time. Treatment involves professionals from multiple fields of study including, but not limited to; occupational and speech therapist who specialize in feeding disorders, dietitians, psychologists and physician. To obtain the best results, treatment should include a behavior modification plan under the guidance of multiple professionals. If the child has oral motor difficulties related to the feeding disorder a pediatric occupational or speech therapist who is trained in feeding disorders and oral motor function should help develop a plan. <ref>{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorder of Early Childhood|url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&id=14504&cn=37|accessdate=26 June 2011|authors=Andrea Barkoukis, M.A., Natalie Staats Reiss, Ph.D., and Mark Dombeck, Ph.D}}</ref>  ==Epidemiology== Some 25% to 40% of infants and children are reported to have feeding problems—mainly [[colic]], vomiting, slow feeding, and refusal to eat.<ref name="cfp journal">{{cite journal|last=Bernard-Bonnin|first=AC|title=Feeding problems of infants and toddlers|journal=Canadian Family Physician|year=2006|volume=Vol 52|issue=Issue 10|url=http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/reprint/52/10/1247}}</ref> It has been reported that up to 80% of infants with developmental handicaps also demonstrate feeding problems while 1 to 2% of infants aged less than one year show severe food refusal and poor growth.<ref name="essentials">{{cite book|last=Kay|first=Jerald|title=Essentials of Psychiatry|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex|isbn=0470018542|pages=1078}}</ref> Among [[Preterm birth|infants born prematurely]], 40% to 70% experience some form of feeding problem.<ref name="minddisorder.com"/>  ==See also== [[Selective eating disorder]]  == References == {{reflist}}  ==External links== *[http://www.kennedykrieger.org/kki_diag.jsp?pid=1084 Kennedy Krieger] list of associated problems *[http://www.asha.org/public/speech/swallowing/feedswallowchildren.htm American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)] Feeding and Swallowing Disorders (Dysphagia) in Children *[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001540.htm U.S. National Library of Medicine] Treating Children With Feeding Disorders   [[Category:Malnutrition]] [[Category:Eating disorders]]</text></page>",

I think the reasons for deletion are only valid at first glance. Yes, [[WP:MOS]] is "only" a guideline but still, constantly deliberately violating without being willing to talk about it will sooner or later be disruptive and, despite the arguments at the TFD, deliberately disrupting Wikipedia in any way, even by persistently breaking WP:MOS ''is'' a reason for a block per [[WP:BLOCK]]. There is one user that comes to mind (who I don't want to name though) who persists on adding credentials to articles, like "Dr.", "Mr.", "MP" etc., in violation of [[WP:CREDENTIAL]]. It became so bad that now whole pages of page revisions consist of their edits to change this and several users reverting them. They have been warned using {{tl|uw-mos1}} to {{tl|uw-mos3}} but they have neither tried to discuss their edits nor reacted in any other way. I think if a user acts in this way, they should be blocked sooner or later because of disruption. But instead of adding a {{tl|uw-vandalism4}} warning, I think the correct way to inform them of their soon-to-be-applied block should be the template that directly tells them what disruptive behavior is not tolerated. {{tl|uw-mos4}} fulfills this purpose in such cases. Regards '''[[User:SoWhy|<span style="font-variant:small-caps; color: #AC0000">So</span>]][[User talk:SoWhy|<span style="font-variant:small-caps; color: #35628F">Why</span>]]''' 23:08, 6 March 2011 (UTC) *As much as a relist for wider input seems entirely reasonable, do you really think a uw-mos4 template is necessary?  It seems to me that any time that a user could be blocked for violations of the MOS, they will have gone far beyond a simple 4-warnings-then-block sort of system and a less general final warning should be given.  The circumstance you describe, for instance, is a much wider pattern than only four instances of MOS violation and the user would benefit more from a personalized note than a templated one.  Cheers.  <font color="green">[[User:Lifebaka|''lifebaka'']]</font>[[User talk:Lifebaka|'''++''']] 03:57, 7 March 2011 (UTC) :*By the same argument, do we really need most of the level 4 warnings? {{tl|uw-generic4}} would cover most such circumstances, wouldn't it? The point is that if a user is bent on disrupting Wikipedia by messing up the layout again and again while probably not acting in bad faith (other than ignoring the warnings and tries to talk to them), then it would be good if the final warning reflected the reason for the block that may happen and didn't just say "stop being disruptive" (but "stop being disruptive by doing..."). Sure, more personal notes are preferable but in the case I used as an example, they didn't help, so I think a big red warning sign saying clearly "you will be blocked" may be helpful as well. Most user warnings can be personalized after all but I like to think that combining it with a templated message may be more effective.

On the one hand, I question whether it's ever really appropriate to block anyone purely for violations of the MOS.  I can imagine circumstances in which they could be blocked for repeatedly and ''disruptively'' violating the MOS, but in that case, the reason for the block is their tendentious behaviour, not the MOS violations ''per se''.  I note that this view was unanimous in the discussion, and I see that Tim Song implemented it.<p>On the other hand, I can see where SoWhy is coming from.  Although the procedure used was the TfD process, in fact what's proposed is more than just an adjustment of our templates—it's effectively a revision to the blocking rules.  Quite a small revision, all things considered, but still, I don't feel 100% comfortable about blocking guidelines being determined by a consensus of three editors at a TfD.<p>I'm going to '''endorse''' Tim Song's closure but then recommend that the template is temporarily '''undeleted''' while SoWhy raises a better-attended discussion in the venue of his choice (RFC, AN, or whatever).—[[User:S Marshall|<font face="Verdana" color="Maroon">'''S Marshall'''</font>]] <small>[[User talk:S Marshall|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/S Marshall|C]]</small> 12:22, 7 March 2011 (UTC) :*The point was that disruptive behavior is usually the reason for a block in such circumstances. Still we have a number of different level 4 warnings that all say "you may be blocked without further warning for being disruptive by doing XXX...". So yeah, the reason for blocking wouldn't be the violations but the constant violations without being willing to talk about the edits or even acknowledging them in any way. That's the disruption in this case and I would propose that the template reflects this if undeleted (e.g. "your constant violations of WP:MOS without being willing to talk about it...").

He was a leading artist in the [[Birmingham]] area between 1850 and 1880, and his work is a valuable historical record of local buildings of that period.  ==Life and work==  Everitt was born in Birmingham, the son of Edward Everitt, an art dealer, and grandson of Allen Everitt, a well-known local artist and art teacher. His maternal grandfather was David Parkes, the [[Shropshire]] [[antiquarian]]. He showed an early talent for art and received lessons from [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], with whom he remained a friend. His specialty was drawing old buildings and their interiors. Taking Birmingham as a centre he made careful drawings of almost every spot in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] of archaeological or historical interest. Between the ages of thirty and forty, he made painting tours of Belgium, France and Germany. After this, he devoted himself particularly to building interiors, his work being mainly carried out in [[watercolour]].<ref name="dnb">{{cite DNB|no-icon=1|prescript=|volume=18|pages=88–89|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/dictionarynatio23stepgoog#page/n100/mode/1up|title=EVERITT, ALLEN EDWARD}}</ref>  [[File:Everitt - Aston Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Aston Hall]] nr. Birmingham]] In 1857, Everitt joined the [[Royal Birmingham Society of Artists]], becoming, in 1858, honorary secretary, a post he held until his death. He taught drawing for many years at the ''[[Deaf and Dumb Institution (Birmingham)|Deaf and Dumb Institution]]'' in Church Road, [[Edgbaston]], of which he was also, virtually, the secretary. In 1870, the archaeological section of the [[Birmingham and Midland Institute|Midlands Institute]] was formed, and Everitt was appointed one of its honorary secretaries.<ref>See: George Griffith. ''History of the free-schools, colleges, hospitals, and asylums of Birmingham'' (London: W.

In June 1880, he was appointed honorary curator of the municipal "Birmingham Free Art Gallery", the forerunner of the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]].<ref name="dnb" />  In 1854, Everitt completed an important series of drawings of [[Aston Hall]], in [[Warwickshire]], which were used to illustrate Davidson's ''History of the holts of Aston, with a description of the family mansion'' (see bibliography). He also illustrated J. B. Bunce's "''History of old [[St Martin in the Bull Ring|St. Martin's]]''" (1875), the parish church of Birmingham.<ref name="dnb" />  In 1880, Everitt married Frances Hudson. He died on 11 June 1882, at Edgbaston, where he had lived most of his life, of "congestion of the lungs".

A [[Franco–Syrian Treaty of Independence (1936)|treaty of independence]] was made in 1936 to grant independence to Syria and end official French rule, but the French parliament refused to accept the agreement. From 1940 to 1941, the Syrian Republic was under the control of [[Vichy France]], and upon liberation in 1941 became a [[sovereign state]]. In 1958, Syria joined with [[Egypt]] in forming the [[United Arab Republic]].  ==French Mandate prior to the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence==  The project of a new constitution was discussed by a Constituent Assembly elected in April 1928, but as the pro-independence [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]] had won a majority and insisted on the insertion of several articles "that did not preserve the prerogatives of the mandatary power", the Assembly was dissolved on August 9, 1928. On May 14, 1930, the [[State of Syria]] was declared the Republic of Syria and a new Syrian constitution was promulgated by the French High Commissioner, in the same time as the Lebanese Constitution, the ''Règlement du Sandjak d'Alexandrette'', the Statute of the Alawi Government, the Statute of the Jabal Druze State.<ref name="takla">Youssef Takla, "[http://books.google.com/books?id=easK2KFwWssC&pg=PA91 Corpus juris du Mandat français]", in: {{cite book|last=|first= S.|title=The British and French Mandates in Comparative Perspectives|editor=Méouchy, Nadine and  Sluglet, Peter (eds.)|publisher=Brill|year=2004|pages=91|isbn=978-90-04-13313-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=easK2KFwWssC|accessdate=2012-04-01|language=French}}</ref> A new flag was also mentioned in this constitution: :The Syrian flag shall be composed as follows, the length shall be double the height.

It promised gradual independence but kept the Syrian Mountains under French control. The Syrian head of state at the time was a French puppet, [[Muhammad 'Ali Bay al-'Abid]]. Fierce opposition to this treaty was spearheaded by senior nationalist and parliamentarian [[Hashim al-Atassi]], who called for a [[1936 Syrian general strike|sixty day strike]] in protest. Atassi's political coalition, the [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]], mobilized massive popular support for his call. Riots and demonstrations raged, and the economy came to a standstill.  ==Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence== {{main|Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence|Sanjak of Alexandretta}}  After negotiations in March with Damien de Martel, the French High Commissioner in Syria, Hashim al-Atassi went to Paris heading a senior Bloc delegation. The new [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]-led French government, formed in June 1936 after the [[French legislative election, 1936|April–May elections]], had agreed to recognize the National Bloc as the sole legitimate representatives of the Syrian people and invited al-Atassi to independence negotiations. The resulting treaty called for immediate recognition of Syrian independence as a sovereign republic, with full emancipation granted gradually over a 25 year period.  In 1936, the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence was signed, a treaty that would not be ratified by the French legislature. However, the treaty allowed Jabal Druze, the Alawite (now called [[Latakia]]), and Alexandretta to be incorporated into the Syrian republic within the following two years. Greater Lebanon (now the Lebanese Republic) was the only state that did not join the Syrian Republic. [[Hashim al-Atassi]], who was Prime Minister under King Faisal's brief reign (1918–1920), was the first president to be elected under a new constitution adopted after the independence treaty.  The treaty guaranteed incorporation of previously autonomous [[Druze]] and [[Alawite]] regions into [[Greater Syria]], but not [[Lebanon]], with which France signed a similar treaty in November. The treaty also promised curtailment of French intervention in Syrian domestic affairs as well as a reduction of French troops, personnel and military bases in Syria. In return, Syria pledged to support France in times of war, including the use of its [[air space]], and to allow France to maintain two military bases on Syrian territory. Other political, economic and cultural provisions were included.  Atassi returned to Syria in triumph on September 27, 1936 and was elected [[List of Presidents of Syria|President of the Republic]] in November.  In September 1938, France again separated the Syrian [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]] and transformed it into the [[State of Hatay]]. The State of Hatay joined Turkey in the following year, in June 1939. Syria did not recognize the incorporation of Hatay into Turkey and the issue is still disputed until the present time.  The emerging threat of [[Adolf Hitler]] induced a fear of being outflanked by [[Nazi Germany]] if France relinquished its colonies in the [[Middle East]]. That, coupled with lingering imperialist inclinations in some levels of the French government, led France to reconsider its promises and refuse to ratify the treaty. Also, France ceded the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]], whose territory was guaranteed as part of Syria in the treaty, to [[Turkey]]. Riots again broke out, Atassi resigned, and Syrian independence was deferred until after [[World War II]].  ==World War II and aftermath==  With the fall of France in 1940 during World War II, Syria came under the control of the [[Vichy Government]] until the British and [[Free French]] [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|invaded and occupied]] the country in July 1941. Syria proclaimed its independence again in 1941 but it wasn't until 1 January 1944, that it was recognized as an independent republic.  In the 1940s, Britain secretly advocated the creation of a Greater Syrian state that would secure Britain preferential status in military, economic and cultural matters, in return for putting a complete halt to Jewish ambition in Palestine. France and the United States opposed British hegemony in the region, which eventually led to the creation of Israel.<ref>https://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/950373.html</ref>  On 27 September 1941, France proclaimed, by virtue of, and within the framework of the Mandate, the independence and sovereignty of the Syrian State. The proclamation said "the independence and sovereignty of Syria and Lebanon will not affect the juridical situation as it results from the Mandate Act. Indeed, this situation could be changed only with the agreement of the Council of the League of Nations, with the consent of the Government of the United States, a signatory of the Franco-American Convention of April 4, 1924, and only after the conclusion between the French Government and the Syrian and Lebanese Governments of treaties duly ratified in accordance with the laws of the French Republic.<ref>See Foreign relations of the United States diplomatic papers, 1941. The British Commonwealth; the Near East and Africa Volume III (1941), pages 809-810; and Statement of General de Gaulle of November 29, 1941, concerning the Mandate for Syria and Lebanon,  Marjorie M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, vol. 1 (Washington, D.C.: U. S. Government Printing Office, 1963) 680-681</ref>  Benqt Broms said that it was important to note that there were several founding members of the United Nations whose statehood was doubtful at the time of the San Francisco Conference and that the Government of France still considered Syria and Lebanon to be mandates.<ref>See International law: achievements and prospects, by Mohammed Bedjaoui, UNESCO, Martinus Nijhoff; 1991, ISBN 92-3-102716-6, page 46 [http://books.google.com/books?id=jrTsNTzcY7EC&pg=PA46&dq=&client=#v=onepage&q=&f=false]</ref>  Duncan Hall said "Thus, the Syrian mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the League or its successor. The mandate was terminated by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: 'The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality.'"<ref>Mandates, Dependencies and Trusteeship, by H. Duncan Hall, Carnegie Endowment, 1948, pages 265-266</ref>  On 29 May 1945, France bombed [[Damascus]] and tried to arrest its democratically elected leaders. While French planes were bombing [[Damascus]], Prime Minister [[Faris al-Khoury]] was at the founding conference of the [[United Nations]] in San Francisco, presenting [[Syria]]'s claim for independence from the [[French Mandate]]. Continuing pressure from Syrian nationalist groups and British pressure forced the French to evacuate their last troops on 17 April 1946.  ==Independence==  Syrian independence was acquired in 1946. Although rapid economic development followed the declaration of independence, Syrian politics from independence through the late 1960s was marked by upheaval. The early years of independence were marked by political instability.  In 1948, Syria was involved in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|Arab-Israeli War]] with the newly created [[State of Israel]]. The Syrian army was pressed out of the [[Israel]]i areas, but fortified their strongholds on the [[Golan]] and managed to keep their old borders and occupy some additional territory.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In July 1949, Syria was the last Arab country to sign an armistice agreement with Israel.  On 29 March 1949, Syria's national government was overthrown by a [[March 1949 Syrian coup d'état|military coup d'état led by Hussni al-Zaim]]. Later that year, on 14 August 1949, Zaim was overthrown by his colleague Sami al-Hinnawi. A few months later, in December 1949, Hinnawi was overthrown by Colonel [[Adib al-Shishakli]]. The latter undermined civilian rule and led to Shishakli's complete seizure of power in 1951. Shishakli continued to rule the country until 1954, when [[1954 Syrian coup d'état|growing public opposition forced him to resign]] and leave the country. The national government was restored, but again to face instability, this time coming from abroad. After the overthrow of President Shishakli in the February [[1954 Syrian coup d'état|1954 coup]], continued political maneuvering supported by competing factions in the military eventually brought Arab nationalist and socialist elements to power. From 1946 to 1956, Syria had 20 different cabinets and drafted four separate constitutions.  During the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, after the invasion of the [[Sinai Peninsula]] by [[Israel]]i troops, and the intervention of British and French troops, [[martial law]] was declared in Syria. Later Syrian and Iraqi troops were brought into [[Jordan]] to prevent a possible Israeli invasion. The November 1956 attacks on Iraqi pipelines were in retaliation for Iraq's acceptance into the [[Baghdad Pact]]. In early 1957 [[Iraq]] advised Egypt and Syria against a conceivable takeover of Jordan.  In November 1956, Syria signed a pact with the [[Soviet Union]], providing a foothold for [[Communist]] influence within the government in exchange for planes, tanks, and other military equipment being sent to Syria. This increase in the strength of Syrian military technology worried [[Turkey]], as it seemed feasible that Syria might attempt to retake [[İskenderun|Iskenderon]], a formerly Syrian city now in Turkey. On the other hand, Syria and the [[USSR]] accused Turkey of massing its troops at the Syrian border. During this standoff, Communists gained more control over the Syrian government and military. Only heated debates in the United Nations (of which Syria was an original member) lessened the threat of war.  Syria's political instability during the years after the 1954 coup, the parallelism of Syrian and [[Egypt]]ian policies, and the appeal of Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdal Nasser]]'s leadership in the wake of the Suez crisis created support in Syria for union with Egypt. On February 1, 1958, Syrian president [[Shukri al-Kuwatli]] and Nasser announced the merging of the two countries, creating the [[United Arab Republic]], and all Syrian political parties, as well as the Communists therein, ceased overt activities.  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{Syria topics}}  {{coord missing|Syria}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Syrian Republic (1930-1958)}} [[Category:Modern history of Syria]] [[Category:World Digital Library related]] [[Category:1930s establishments in Mandatory Syria]]</text></page>",

It was described by Resser in 1938, and the type species is ''Acmarhachis typicalis''.<ref>[http://www.trilobites.info/generic_names_Jell%26Adrain2003.pdf Available Generic Names for Trilobites] P.A.

As in all Agnostina, ''Acmarhachis'' has two [[thorax]] segments. When Agnostina are enroled, a tiny opening between the cephalon and the thorax becomes visible (the cephalothoracic aperture) that uniquely distinguishes this group from the [[Eodiscina]]. A feature shared with all Agnostoidea is that the frontal lobe of the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is not laterally expanded compared to the backward lobe, like in the [[Condylopygoidea]]. In ''Acmarhachis'' the furrow at midline between the front of the glabella and the border is weak or absent. The glabella has a long [[Ogive|ogival]] to [[Rectangle|subquadrate]] front lobe, and the furrow defining it at its back is straight. The back lobe of the glabella is accompanied by two triangular basal lobes of moderate to large size. On the pygidium the axis or rhachis reaches the border. It is divided along its length in three lobes. It is shaped a bit like an [[amphora]], the back pointed and strongly constricted across the middle lobe. The middle lobe also carries a node where it contacts the posterior lobe.<ref name='Treatise'/>  ==References== {{reflist}}  [[Category:Agnostida]] [[Category:Cambrian trilobites]] [[Category:Fossils of Canada]] [[Category:Fossils of Kazakhstan]]</text></page>",

The second is a piece in the entertainment section of the JPost, which talks about the comedy act named 'Comedy for Koby', nothing about the murders. The third is again in a local paper-the JPost, which is an interview with the father of Koby talking about the Itamar attacks, not about the murder of Koby. I think it is quite clear outside Israel the murders are quite unimportant and not talked about. Also, according to Roscelese the legislation in the US congress which many of the keep voters mentioned was never passed. So, I think this murder case is like many that happen everyday, it is in the local news, and possibly international news when it is part of a greater conflict or a famous person, but by the end of the week it is non-notable.

He was co-advised by Gordon McAlpine after Kirshner moved to Harvard.  His dissertation established the existence of small, dwarf galaxies with emission-lines on the edges of galaxy supercluster voids.  Moody did post-doctoral research at ''The Institute for Astronomy'' at the [[University of New Mexico]] where he worked with Stephen Gregory and Jack Burns on questions of large-scale galaxy structure.  Following this, Moody was a professor of astronomy at [[Weber State University]] until he joined the BYU faculty in 1990 as a professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department .  Moody is best known for his work in astronomical publishing. He served three years as assistant managing editor of the ''Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series'' (''ASPCS'') from 2001 to 2004 when he was appointed as Managing Editor, a post he held for 5 years until 2009.  Under his direction the ''ASPCS'', the largest publisher of astronomical conference information in the world, transitioned to full electronic submissions and distribution without a decline in service or revenue. He was elected to the ''American Astronomical Society'' publications board serving from December 2010 to 2014.  Moody received both the BYU Alcuin Award and Karl G. Maeser General Education Professorship for excellence in general education teaching. He was involved in The KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey.<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/120/1/80 report of the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey]</ref> and is the principal author of the textbook '''''Physical Science Foundations'''''.

His first position was [[Archbishop of Brisbane]] and he finished in post as [[Bishop of London]].  He ministered to many people over his lifetime (1885 – 1977) and worked in many cities and towns. Bishop Wand School decided to choose some of the places where the Bishop visited and ministered as its House names.<ref>[http://www.designs365.co.uk/bishopwand/Pages/19.%20House%20System.pdf House System] Bishop Wand School - retrieved 2014-10-30.</ref>  A small minority of the [[ecclesiastical parish|parish]] land has long belonged to St Paul's in return for annual funding and the [[advowson|right to appoint the vicar]]: in 1222 the right to appoint the vicar of Sunbury-on-Thames was transferred along with the [[feudal system|manor]] from Westminster Abbey to the body representing the cathedral, the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's.

'''''Sterne's Captive''''', first exhibited by the artist in 1778, is a similar painting by Wright in the [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]]. The latter painting resulted in a very rare engraving, as its purchaser commissioned a print run of only twenty copies before the copper printing plate was destroyed. In 2012, Derby Museum commissioned another ''Captive painting'' from Emma Tooth.  ==Description== Both paintings shows the despair of a traveller who finds himself abandoned in a foreign jail.<ref name=tate/> ''The Captive'' title is based on the section of the same name in [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'' (1768). In the episode in question, the hero of the story, Yorick, imagines that he is imprisoned in the [[Bastille]] because he has lost his passport. Yorick is later released because his name is taken to indicate that he is an important person, because he is a court jester: [[Yorick]] is a jester in Shakespeare's play ''[[Hamlet]]''. The journey takes place in 1762, when Britain was [[Seven Years' War|at war with France]], and imprisonment was a real possibility for a traveller from a hostile country.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Sentimental Journey and Other Writings|last= Sterne|first= Laurence|editor1-first=Ian|editor1-last=Jack|editor2-first=Tim|editor2-last=Parnell|year=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=978-0-19-953718-1|page=236}}</ref>  ==History== [[File:Captive John Stavely study.jpg|thumb|left|A study of John Stavely for Wright's second version]] The pose of the model in Wright's first painting is the same as that used by [[Michelangelo]] when painting [[The Creation of Adam]] on the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]].<ref name=sour/> And the first ''captive'' painting was made by Wright while in Rome in 1774. After its completion he had to import it back into Britain; [[Llewellyn Jewitt]] records that he nearly imported it free of tax but a late objection obliged him to pay import tax. The debate focused on whether the sitter was Roman and it was argued that the sitter should have been better dressed.<ref name=jewitt>{{cite journal|last=Jewitt|first=Llewellyn|journal=The Art Journal London p353|year=1866|volume=5|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M45CAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA353&dq=captive+joseph+wright&hl=en&ei=1P8NTtnTJ4X6sgbrueGIDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=captive%20joseph%20wright&f=false|title= Wright|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> <ref name="nicolson">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA54&dq=Guy+of+Lusignan+prisoner&hl=en&ei=24gLTvS_JsiBhQf59LnmDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&q=captive%20king&f=false Joseph Wright of Derby:Painter of Light], Benedict Nicolson</ref>  The first painting was made into a [[stipple engraving]] by [[Thomas Ryder]] in 1779 and it was published by [[John Boydell|John]] and [[Josiah Boydell]] in 1786.<ref name=tate>[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/gothicnightmares/rooms/room4.htm Room 4: Gothic Gloom], The Tate, London</ref> However an earlier [[Mezzotint|mezzotint engraving]] by [[John Raphael Smith]] of the later 1778 painting had been commissioned by [[John Milnes]] after he bought the painting at a [[Royal Academy]] show.

In 2012, Derby Museum commissioned the English Artist Emma Tooth to create a painting based on Wright's paintings. She chose to mimic the construction of ''The Captive''. She took the classical pose of the captive in Wright's version and moved it to a modern man who has chosen to waste his time in front of the television. Tooth noted that the man in the painting (and the model) has "don’t count the days, make the days count" tattooed on his chest.<ref name=sour>{{cite web|title=Picks of the Harvest|url=http://www.sourharvest.com/|publisher=Sour Harvest Exhibition|accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{Derby Museum}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Captive (painting)}} [[Category:Paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby]] [[Category:1770s paintings]]</text></page>",

The two ships were launched as [[SS Gneisenau (1935)|''Gneisenau'']] and ''Potsdam'' in 1935 and operated in peace time by [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]]. After the outbreak of war, the ships were requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as transports, and in May 1942, plans were drawn up to convert them into aircraft carriers. The ships were not identical, but were similar enough in size to allow identical outfitting.  ''Gneisenau'' and ''Potsdam'' were to be renamed ''Jade'' and ''Elbe'', respectively. Once converted, the ships were intended to operate twelve [[Ju-87]] Stuka dive bombers and twelve [[Bf-109]] fighters. Work on ''Jade'' was not started and the conversion project was abandoned in November 1942. She returned to service as a [[troopship]], only to be sunk by a mine in the western [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. ''Elbe'' actually began the conversion process in December 1942, but only her passenger fittings were removed by the time work was halted in February 1943. She was converted into a [[barracks ship]] in [[Gotenhafen]] and seized by [[Great Britain]] after the end of the war. She remained in use until 1976, when she was broken up for scrap  ==Conversion== Following the loss of the battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] in May 1941, during which British aircraft carriers proved instrumental, and the near torpedoing of her sistership [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] by carrier-launched aircraft in March 1942, the Kriegsmarine became convinced of the necessity of acquiring aircraft carriers.<ref name=GD>Garzke & Dulin, p. 296</ref> Work on the purpose-built carrier [[German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'']], which had been halted in April 1940, was resumed in March 1942.<ref>Gröner, p. 72</ref> The Kriegsmarine also decided to convert a number of vessels into auxiliary aircraft carriers. Several passenger ships, including ''Gneisenau'', ''Potsdam'', and [[SS Europa (1928)|''Europa'']] were selected for conversion, along with the incomplete [[heavy cruiser]] [[German cruiser Seydlitz|''Seydlitz'']].<ref name=GD/> ''Gneisenau'' and ''Potsdam'' had been built in the mid-1930s and operated by [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] on its East Asia Service until the outbreak of war, when they were requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as troopships.<ref name=G/>  The ships were found to have insufficient stability when converted into aircraft carriers. This was to have been remedied by the addition of side bulges and fixed ballast. The ballast was to have consisted of "concrete armor," a layer of concrete fitted to the sides of the hulls below the waterline. Conversion work on ''Gneisenau'', which was to be renamed ''Jade'', never began. The project was abandoned on 25 November 1942. The design for ''Potsdam'', which was assigned the name ''Elbe'', was reworked to correct the stability problems. The bulges and concrete armor were discarded and a second outer skin was substituted. Work began on the ship in December 1942; only the ship's passenger fittings were removed by the time work was halted on 2 February 1943.<ref name=G/> This was due to the resignation of Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], the commander in chief of the Kriegsmarine, the previous month.<ref name=GD/> Raeder had resigned in protest of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s order that all surface ships be decommissioned and scrapped in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]].<ref>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 221</ref>  ''Gneisenau'' was returned to troopship duties after the project was abandoned, but at 12:02 on 2 May 1943, she was sunk by a [[naval mine|mine]] off [[Gedser]]. ''Potsdam'' was converted into a [[barracks ship]] in [[Gotenhafen]], where she spent the remainder of the war. Following the German defeat, the ship was seized by the British on 20 June 1946 as a [[war prize]], who commissioned her as a troop transport under the name [[List of Empire ships (F)#Empire Fowey|''Empire Fowey'']]. She was sold to Pakistan, who operated her under the name ''Safina-E-Hujjaj'' until she was broken up for scrap in 1976.<ref name=G/>  ===Characteristics=== ''Jade'' was {{convert|191|m|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|203|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]].

If anyone can even be said to rule in Chronias, that being would be Zaphkiel. Zaphkiel is the mysterious ruler of the Hebdomad, and is the only one who has held his position since it was created; all other previous members having perished in combating fiends or gone on to join the essence of their planes. Zaphkiel embodies the "perfect good," and only the most righteous and exalted individuals can stand in his presence without being consumed. Zaphkiel is the patron of dead children and stillborn babies and watches over their spirits. Beyond this Zaphkiel's motivations and plans are unknowable, though it is known that he intends to make the planes as good as they can be, and only he can promote an archon into the Hebdomad.  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{D&D topics}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Zaphkiel (Dungeons and Dragons)}} [[Category:Dungeons & Dragons extraplanar creatures]]   {{D&D-char-stub}}</text></page>",

Carson began her career as a biologist in the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s.  Her widely praised 1951 bestseller ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'' won her financial security and recognition as a gifted writer.  Her next book, ''[[The Edge of the Sea]]'', and the republished version of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'', were also bestsellers.  Together, her sea trilogy explores the whole of [[ocean]] life, from the shores to the surface to the deep sea.  In early 1953, Carson began library and field research on the [[ecology]] and [[organism]]s of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, ''[[The Edge of the Sea]]'', which focuses on life in [[coastal]] [[ecosystem]]s (particularly along the [[Eastern Seaboard]]). It appeared in ''The New Yorker'' in two condensed installments shortly before the October 26 book release. By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; ''The Edge of the Sea'' received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for ''The Sea Around Us''.  Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson had become concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the [[military funding of science]] since [[World War II]].  It was the USDA's 1957 fire ant eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons.  The [[fire ant]] program involved aerial spraying of [[DDT]] and other pesticides (mixed with [[fuel oil]]), including the spraying of private land.  Landowners in Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.  ''[[Silent Spring]]'' was written by Rachel Carson and published by [[Houghton Mifflin]] on 27 September 1962. The book is widely credited with helping launch the [[environmental movement]].  | link    =  Rachel Carson | page    = biographies | archive = }}</text></page>",

A site atop a {{convert|175|ft|adj=on}} cliff was chosen for the light, and construction commenced in 1856 on the first lighthouse located here; the light was put into service with a fourth-order [[Fresnel lens]] later that year.<ref name = "pepper"/>  However, due to the poor quality of materials used in construction, the condition of the building deteriorated rapidly, and by 1865 the light was judged to be in "wretched condition."<ref name = "pepper"/>  A replacement was recommended, and Congress appropriated more money the following year.  In 1867, the second Grand Island North Light Station was built.  This was before the founding of nearby Munising, or indeed the before the establishment of the surrounding county of Alger.<ref name = "state"/> The light house was built of brick, using standard plans provided by the U.S. Lighthouse Establishment. The lens was transferred from the old tower, and the light was put into service the same year.<ref name = "pepper"/>  A keeper and an assistant were stationed at the lighthouse; over the years a few minor changes were made to the boathouse location and associated stairs.  In 1941, the lamp was automated and the station was boarded up and abandoned.<ref name = "pepper"/> In 1961, a 12-volt electrical system was installed on a pole near the cliff, the earlier light was decommissioned, and the Fresnel lens removed.<ref name = "pepper"/>  The station, now surplus, was sold to [[Loren Graham]].<ref name = "pepper"/> Restoration work was done in 1972 - 1973.<ref name = "state"/> The lighthouse and associated buildings are currently used as a private summer home.<ref name = "state"/>  ==Description== The Grand Island North Light Station is a two-story building constructed of brick in a rectangular plan.  A three-story, {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} light tower and a one-story kitchen addition are attached to the station. The station has a tin-covered gable roof supported by queen-post trusses. The exterior is painted in the original colors of yellow, white, and black, and the station as a whole looks substantially as it did when built. The tower once housed a fourth-order Fresnal lens.<ref name = "state"/>  Four other buildings are located on the site: a tool shed, fuel storage shed, and outhouse (all made of brick); and a wooden well-house.<ref name = "state"/>  ==See also== * [[Lighthouses in the United States]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{Lighthouses of Michigan}} {{National Register of Historic Places}}  [[Category:Lighthouses completed in 1867]] [[Category:Houses completed in 1867]] [[Category:Towers completed in 1867]] [[Category:Lighthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan]] [[Category:Lighthouses in Alger County, Michigan]]</text></page>",

The neighborhood is located in the southeast section of Baltimore city and borders the 137 acre park of the same name on the north and east sides. Patterson Park is traditionally centered on the intersection of Baltimore Street and Linwood Avenue and until the formation of Patterson Park Neighborhood Association in 1986 was referred to as the Baltimore-Linwood Neighborhood. The original borders of Patterson Park neighborhood were Pratt Street to the south, Fayette Street to the north, Milton Street to the west and Clinton Street to the east, but in 2011 the Patterson Park Neighborhood Association voted to expand the northern border to Orleans Street between Milton and Curley Street.  Roughly two miles east of [[Downtown Baltimore|Baltimore's downtown district]], Patterson Park is near the neighborhoods of [[Butchers Hill, Baltimore|Butchers Hill]], [[Canton, Maryland|Canton]], [[Fells Point]], [[Highlandtown, Baltimore|Highlandtown]], and [[McElderry Park, Baltimore|McElderry Park]].  ==History==  ===Founding=== Patterson Park homes were first developed between the mid-19th century and early 20th century to accommodate the swelling population of Baltimore City after the Civil War.  [[William Patterson (Maryland)|William Patterson]] owned much of the land that now constitutes the Patterson Park neighborhood. In 1827, he donated 5 acres of land in what we now know as [[Patterson Park, Baltimore|Patterson Park]] to the city for a public walk. His heirs were less interested in donating the land that remained; and instead leased the land to speculative builders, who then raised rowhouses on it. The builders sold these homes at a profit, while the Patterson heirs collected [[ground rent]] on the leased land.<ref name="Patterson Park Neighbors">[http://www.pattersonparkneighbors.org/history/index.html Origins] Origins of Patterson Park. Retrieved 2011-09-26</ref>  Affectionately known as "marble houses," the typical Patterson Park rowhouse was built in [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]], or Italianate, style. They have restrained flat roofs; flat, brown or red brick façades; molded and galvanized sheet-metal exterior cornices, often stamped with neoclassical decoration and dressed up with ball finials; stained glass transoms; and marble steps and trim.  In the latter half of the 19th century, immigrant European laborers as well as free blacks like [[Frederick Douglass]] flocked to Baltimore seeking jobs in the waterfront factories, rail yards and wharves. The architect-designed homes of Bolton Hill and Mount Vernon were beyond their reach, but speculative builders built block upon block of narrow [[Terraced house|rowhouses]] on inexpensive land, including around Patterson Park.  Architectural details changed over time, as building and manufacturing process advanced. For example, when plate glass became affordable in the late 1890s, builders replaced the tall, narrow Palladian first floor windows with a single, wide plate glass window—some arched, some square.  Three-story Victorians built circa 1900 to 1910 line the park's border. Two-story rowhomes dating from the 1920s line quaint and narrow side streets, some still paved with brick. Interiors often feature pressed tin ceilings, hardwood floors, stained glass windows and ornate moldings. Many houses still have original marble steps.  By 1927, many of the immigrants were from [[Bohemia]], thanks to the growth of the [[History of the Czechs in Baltimore|Czech]] population in nearby [[East Monument Historic District|Little Bohemia]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Baltimore's Patterson Park|last= Almaguer|first= Tim|authorlink= |year= 2006|publisher= [[Arcadia Publishing]]|location= Mount Pleasant, South Carolina|isbn= 0-7385-4365-9|page= 81|pages= |accessdate=August 28, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yYDTFqpImgUC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=Baltimore+Telegraf+Czech&source=bl&ots=lPAjB251jj&sig=uKg5oO_f8c192Q8Fxj1KgBTg-5M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IhY9UJLZCcXF6wGwrYDoBg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>  ===Decline=== The exodus of middle-class—and aspiring middle-class—whites from the city center is not unique to the Patterson Park community. This is a characteristically American settlement pattern, stimulated by the advent of the electric trolley (streetcar) in 1888, and accelerated by social and economic transitions since then.  The fabric of Southeast Baltimore's working class communities was woven from the availability of good blue-collar jobs in the manufacturing industries surrounding the waterfront. Plant closures, layoffs, and the general decline of the manufacturing sector began to weaken that fabric in the 1960s.  Changes in the city's demographic composition fed fears and prejudice among residents who were suffering economic hardships. Profound social shifts arising from the civil rights movement strengthened the case for elimination of residential housing segregation, but the unintended consequence was white flight. Absentee landlords, property abandonment, predatory lending and property flipping fed the decline in Baltimore's downtown communities.  Concerted efforts by the city's political and business establishment began to focus on downtown redevelopment in the 1970s. Such efforts slowed but did not halt housing abandonment and disinvestment in Southeast Baltimore in general, and Patterson Park in particular.  The mid-1990s were a particularly difficult time for Patterson Park, as nearby public housing estates were shut down abruptly, leaving nearby residents looking for housing options. Absentee landlords in the Patterson Park neighborhood took advantage of the new transient population. The stresses further weakened the neighborhood.  ===Revitalization===  ====Patterson Park Community Development Corporation==== In 1996, the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation (PPCDC) was created to increase ownership rates and decreased vacancies in the area. Founder Ed Rutkowski had created the Patterson Park Neighborhood Initiative, hiring organizers to gather neighbors to define the issues affecting their neighborhoods including crime, less-than-robust city services and nuisances. Between 1996 and 2009, the PPCDC renovated about 300 Patterson Park rowhomes, many vacant. Since 1996, the area's vacancy rate declined from nearly twice that of the rest of Baltimore City to less than the average, the crime rate has dropped to less than half for violent offenses, and the average housing value has nearly tripled.  In February 2009, the collapse of the housing market led the PPCDC to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.<ref name="Community Development Corporation">[http://www.abell.org/programareas/highlights/patterson2.html Patterson Park Community Development Corporation] Abell Foundation Patterson Park Community Development Corporation.

Founded to encourage city residents to be involved in community activities, PPNA has 300 active members.<ref name="About PPNA">[http://www.pattersonparkneighbors.org/about/index.html] About Patterson Park Neighbors Retrieved 2011-09-27</ref> The PPNA encourages neighborliness and foster resident volunteerism. The Association holds a monthly community meeting in a local church basement, and organizes block clean-ups, tree and flower plantings, holiday parties, pot lucks, home tours and block parties.  ====Leadership==== PPNA leadership consists of an elected board, one president, four vice presidents, one treasurer, and one secretary. The vice presidents each represent one sector of PPNA: North, South, East and West Sectors with the dividing line of the sectors generally being Linwood Avenue and Baltimore Street. Elections take place every January and every seat is voted on during elections. Officeholders must live within Patterson Park borders and be a paying PPNA member.  ====Greening Committee==== In a partnership with the Baltimore Neighborhood Energy Challenge, the PPNA Greening Committee is working to reduce the energy consumption of Baltimore by educating and encouraging residents to pledge to reduce their household energy use through efficiency. The Greening Committee has also been awarded over $60,000 in donations to finance its project, including major support from the Chesapeake Bay Trust, a state-chartered grant maker, and Healthy Neighborhoods Inc., a local nonprofit for tree plantings in the neighborhood.<ref name="Neighbors plant trees, good feelings in East Baltimore">[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-12-11/news/bs-md-ci-patterson-park-trees-20101210_1_tree-canopy-new-trees-free-trees] Patterson Park Tree Plantings Retrieved 2011-09-27</ref>  ====Alley gating==== In 2010, PPNA has fostered gated alleys: residents gate both ends of an alley and make it a park-like space for neighbors to enjoy.<ref name="A new life for Baltimore alleys">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/gallery/2010/05/26/GA2010052602989.html] Baltimore Gated Alleys Retrieved 2011-09-27</ref>  ==Boundaries and Population== Patterson Park is bounded by Baltimore Street to the south, Patterson Park Avenue to the west, Orleans Street to the north, and Linwood Avenue to the east.

These are paltry numbers for a neologism article). The article further has little to no actual content, not covered by, say, [[anti-vaccination]] or similar. The article itself admits that it's poorly-defined. Further, while claiming to be a separate term from anti-vaccinationist, many of the people who are supposedly separate from the anti-vaccination movement are, in fact, the ''leading lights'' of the anti-vaccination movement, which makes the distinction extremely dubious. Probably Original research.   Long story short, there is no evidence this term has any notability as a distinct term, nor that it has ever been consistently used (and it's not been used very much!) to make the distinction the article wishes to draw. I'll buy that someone, somewhere, might have tried to make the distinction - but it hasn't caught on, and I can find no evidence that anyone accepts this definiton.  [[Nonce words]] are words that are created for a very specific purpose, that are unlikely to come up again. For instance, one muight create the unlikely term dechickenization in your story about a mad scientist who stuck the hero's brain in a chicken. It wouldn't appear in a dictionary, but the meaning is clear.

The head office is situated in [[Fredrikstad]]. Jøtul AS is also the parent company in the Jøtul Group, with subsidiaries in the [[USA]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Poland]].  ==History== Jøtul was founded by [[Oluf Onsum]] as '''Kværner Jernstøberi''' (''Kværner Foundry'') in the outskirts of Christiania (now [[Oslo]]) in 1853. While stoves initially were the main products, the company had diversified by the beginning of the 20th century, when it produced [[turbine]]s and lumber equipment. As the heating appliance manufacture decreased in importance, the production was spun off in 1916 and sold to Herman Anker, one of Kværner's managers. He founded Jøtul AS in 1920 as a sales organization for its products. The sales stagnated during the [[Great Depression|depression]] in the 1920s, and 36 year old Herman Anker died in 1927, leaving it to his successor, 34 year old Johannes Gahr to modernize and eventually salvage the company. By 1935, the turnaround had succeeded, and the firm acquired its modern name.  By the 1960s, stoves using liquid fuels, especially [[kerosene]] had supplanted wood burning appliances, a trend that was only reversed in the 1970s, partly due to the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Jøtul used this opportunity to gain a strong international foothold and drastically increased its exports to continental [[Europe]] and [[North America]].  The Gahr family sold the business to [[Norcem]] in 1977, and a period of international expansion began, as Jøtul acquired a number of foundries and importers abroad. This period lasted for approximately ten years, but came to an end during the recession in the late 1980s, when Jøtul once again focussed on the domestic market. However, it has resumed its international diversification in the 21st century, and today its products are sold worldwide.  Jøtul is now owned by the private equity companies [[Ratos]] and [[Accent Equity Partners]], plus the management of the Jøtul Group.<ref name="History">{{cite web | url        = http://www.jotul.com/wwwjotulno/Main-Menu/Om-Jotul/Bedriftsinformasjon/Historikk/ | title      = Historikk | publisher  = Jøtul AS | accessdate = 2011-10-17 | language   = Norwegian }}</ref>  ==Products and markets== The Jøtul Group sells and markets its products under the brands ''Jøtul, Scan, Atra, Ild, Warm, Jøtul Group Accessories'' and ''Jøtul Group Chimney System'' throughout North and [[South America]], Europe, [[South Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]].<ref name="Homepage">{{cite web | url        = http://www.jotul.com/wwwjotulcom/ | title      = International homepage | publisher  = Jøtul AS | accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}</ref>  Jøtul products have received several design awards from both the [[Norwegian Design Council]]<ref>{{cite web | url        = http://www.norskdesign.no/search-category/category169.html?categoryID=169&articlesearchstring=J%C3%B8tul | title      = Search result: Jøtul design awards | publisher  = [[Norwegian Design Council]] | accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}</ref> and [[Red Dot|Red dot design awards]].<ref>{{cite web | url        = http://en.red-dot.org/2858.html?&cHash=2bd372ef64e9cb54b7d1d09934cf2140&detail=7608 | title      = Red Dot design products awards 2011: Jøtul F 162 & 163 Stoves | publisher  = [[Red Dot]] | accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url        = http://en.red-dot.org/2858.html?&cHash=1777e62b299a734fcbb65a092ae03a8d&detail=3670 | title      = Red Dot design products awards 2007: Jøtul 373 wood burning stove | publisher  = [[Red Dot]] | accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url        = http://en.red-dot.org/2243.html | title      = The best designers of the red dot design award 2007 in interview: Anna Oeren | publisher  = [[Red Dot]] | accessdate = 2011-10-17 }}</ref>  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Jotul}} [[Category:HVAC manufacturing companies]] [[Category:Norwegian brands]] [[Category:Companies established in 1853]] [[Category:1853 establishments in Norway]] [[Category:Manufacturing companies of Norway]] [[Category:Engineering companies of Norway]] [[Category:Companies based in Østfold]]</text></page>",

The Residence, whose buildings are now part of [[Chernivtsi University]], was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2011.  ==Construction== In 1782, following the incorporation of Bukovina into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the seat of the [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Moldavian Eastern Orthodox]] Bishops of [[Rădăuți]] was moved to Chernivtsi (then known as Czernowitz). The province's military administration built a residence in haste for bishop [[Dositei Herescu]]. The edifice, completed in 1783, bore a shabby aspect, divided as it was into small, low rooms, with a little chapel that had a brick floor. Due to fungal growth caused by humidity, part of the building collapsed in 1790 and the rest was demolished. Thus, Herescu and his successors [[Daniil Vlahovici]], [[Isaia Baloșescu]] and, for a time, [[Eugenie Hacman]], were obliged to move around rented rooms. In 1851-1852, Hacman sent a series of reports to the administration in [[Lviv]], complaining that this situation was undignified. In 1860, the Religious Affairs Ministry issued a decree announcing a contest to select an architect for a new episcopal residence. The [[Czechs|Czech]] architect Josef Hlávka was selected to develop the project.<ref>Luceac (2008) 79.</ref><ref>Chuchko (2012) 11.</ref>  In preparing his designs, Hlávka researched the building traditions of the region, and published an article, "Buildings of the Eastern Greek Church in Bukovina", in the ''Austrian Review'' in 1866.<ref>Chuchko (2012) 14.</ref> Hlávka's proposals for the complex included not only the bishop's palace but also administrative offices, meeting halls, a library, a choir school, a museum of church art and a chapel.<ref>Chuchko (2012) 20-21.</ref> The resulting work combines [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] style, with the [[Alhambra]] as one inspiration.<ref>Luceac (2008) 80.</ref>  Construction commenced in 1864<ref>Chuchko (2012) 26.</ref> but was subjected to substantial delays due to technical problems, the illness of Hlávka from 1872 onwards, and to disagreements between Hlávka and  the local administration, which led to Hlávka's resignation.<ref>Chuchko (2012) 44-8.</ref> The incompetence of Hlávka's successor, Feliks Ksiezarski, further delayed progress.<ref>Chuchko (2012) 50.</ref> The building and churches were consecrated in the winter of 1882/3.<ref>Chuchko (2012) 74.</ref>  ==Significance== The UNESCO citation, declaring the Residence and the buildings in its complex as of "outstanding universal value", describes the site as follows:<blockquote>The architectural ensemble comprises the former Residence of the Metropolitans with its St. Ivan of [[Suceava]] Chapel; the former [[seminary]] and Seminary Church, and the former [[monastery]] with its clock tower within a garden and landscaped park. The Residence, with a dramatic fusion of architectural references, expresses the 19th century cultural identity of the Orthodox Church within the Austro-Hungarian Empire during a period of religious and cultural toleration. In the 19th century, [[historicism|historicist]] architecture could convey messages about its purpose and the Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans is an excellent example.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1330 Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans] on the UNESCO  website, accessed 14 May 2013</ref></blockquote>  ==Features== The buildings of the complex are laid out on three sides of a courtyard which is approximately 100 metres deep and 70 metres wide:<ref>UNESCO (2011), 331.</ref> the fourth side of this yard contains the main gates, set in tall railings.  Opposite the gate is the largest single building, the residence of the Metropolitan, which also contains the Chapel of [[John the New of Suceava]].

Initially Bulgaria was to deliver 20,000 Jews to the Germans. The plan's first step called for the "purification" of the Bulgarian occupied territories of Thrace and Macedonia. In March 1943, Bulgarian police rounded up the Jews of Thrace and Macedonia at night and placed them in detention camps under extremely harsh conditions. Their property and their houses were confiscated prior to their deportation in the later part of the month. Sealed trains transported 11,384 Jews, mainly via the Danube River, to death camps, from which almost none returned.

With the war raging around their borders, the Macedonians remain cocooned in their world of patriotic pleasures, primarily concerned about getting the beleaguered Macedonia Football Club on a winning streak. Their manager hires the legendary German-Jewish coach Rudolph Spitz to turn them into champions. But when the Nazi occupation begins and they start deporting Jews, Kosta and his teammates realize that the carefree days of their youth are over. As the Nazis try to sabotage the outcome of the championship game, and Spitz's life is threatened, Kosta and his teammates rise to the challenge to protect their coach, with all of Macedonia cheering them on.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_third_half/ Rotten Tomatoes]</ref>  ==Cast== *[[Sasko Kocev]] as Kosta *[[Katarina Ivanovska]] as Rebecca Cohen **[[Bedija Begovska]] as Rebecca in 2012 *[[Richard Sammel]] as Rudolph Spitz, a Prussian footballer-turned-coach hired to coach FC Macedonia *[[Rade Šerbedžija]] as Don Rafael Cohen, a wealthy Jewish banker and Rebecca's father *[[Emil Ruben]] as Garvanov, a Bulgarian colonel *[[Mitko S.

This means that the term is used in the following way: "the master...affranchises the slave".<ref>{{cite book |title=  Letters on Ancient and Modern History |author =[[John Bigland|Bigland, John]] |year=1808 |publisher= (via [[Google Books]]) |location= |isbn= |page=224 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MLcvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate= February 12, 2012}}</ref>  ==Evolution== ''A History of Ancient Greece'' explains that in the context of [[Ancient Greece]], affranchisement came in many forms. A master choosing to free his slave would most likely only do it "at his death, specifying his desire in his will". In rare cases, slaves who were able to earn enough money through labour were able to buy their own freedom. They were known as ''choris oikointes''. Two 4th-century bankers, [[Pasion]] and [[Phormio]], used to be slaves before they bought their freedom. A slave could also be sold fictitiously to a [[sanctuary]], from where a god could enfranchise him. In very rare circumstances, the city could affranchise a slave. A notable example of this is when [[Athens]] liberated everyone who was present at the [[Battle of Arginusae]] in 406BC. Even once a slave was affranchised, there would still be ties between him (who became a [[metic]]) and his master (who became a [[prostatès]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=  A History of Ancient Greece |author = [[Claude Orrieux|Orrieux, Claude]]; [[Pauline Schmitt Pantel|Pantel, Pauline Schmitt]] |year=1999 |publisher= [[Presses Universitaires de France]] (via [[Google Books]]) |location= |isbn=0-631-20308-7 |page=187 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=b8cA8hymTw8C&lpg=PA188&dq=Affranchise&pg=PA183#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate= February 12, 2012}}</ref>  ==Modern usage== * In his book ''The Uprising of a Great People'', author [[Agenor Gasparin]] ([[Mary Louise Booth|Mary Booth]], translator) uses the term affranchisement in the context of the American freedom movement from the [[British Empire]].<ref name="Gasp">{{cite book |title = The Uprising of a Great People |last= Gasparin |first= Agenor |authorlink=Agenor Gasparin|others = [[Mary Louise Booth]], translator |year=1862 |publisher= [[Applewood Books]] (via [[Google Books]]) |location= |isbn=|page=28 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mqpK-tY-ow0C&lpg=PA35&vq=affranchisement&pg=PA35#v=snippet&q=affranchisement&f=false|accessdate= February 12, 2012}}</ref>  * According to ''[[The European Magazine, and London Review]]'', volume 44, in the sixth volume of her book ''Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries'', [[Mary Hays]] uses the term affranchisement to denote the willingness of French nobility to free their [[vassal]]s in the chapter dealing with [[Catherine the Great]].<ref name="mary">(1803).

"<page><title>Eleanor Ambrose</title><text>'''Eleanor Ambrose''' (1718–1816) was a celebrated beauty and Catholic heiress. Her father, Michael, was well-educated but disbarred from several professions by his religion. He became a [[brewer]] and made his fortune. He resided at Mount Ambrose, [[Swords, County Dublin]].  Eleanor was described as "beautiful, witty, intellectual and a fevent [[patriotism|patriot]]" who "managed to penetrate Dublin society, despite the fact that she was a Catholic. Indeed, she became a darling of the Viceregal Court, and during the Viceroyalty of [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]], she and her sister Clara were the prominent socialites of the Castle set. Chesterfield was attracted to her, and she soon accompanied him to all official ceremonies. Influenced by her opinions, Chesterfield is reported to have told [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] that ''poverty not Popery was to be feared in Ireland'', he had found ''only one dangerous papist, the brightness of whose eyes and charms, and whose conversation were indeed dangerous'', and her name was Eleanor Ambrose".<ref>http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/big-houses-of-ireland/kenure-house/roger-palmer/</ref>  However, Eleanor ensured the relationship stayed [[platonic love|platonic]].  {{quote|"At one of the Castle balls, given on the anniversary of the battle of the Boyne, she appeared with an orange lily in her breast, upon which Chesterfield improvised the following lines:  :"''Say, lovely [[Tory (British political party)|tory]], where's the jest'' :''Of wearing orange on thy breast,'' :''When that same breast uncovered shows'' :''The whiteness of the rebel rose?''"<ref name=libraryireland>http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/MissAmbrose.php</ref>}}  In 1752 she married Roger Palmer of Castle Lackin, [[County Mayo]] (created [[baronet]] 1777) and had issue. She died at her house on [[Henry Street, Dublin]], in 1816, "retaining to the last a vehement hatred of the wrongs under which her Catholic fellow-countrymen laboured."<ref name=libraryireland/>  ==See also== * [[Palmer Baronets]] * [[Mary Barber]]  ==References== {{Reflist}}  ==External links== * http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000301263  {{Persondata | NAME              = Ambrose, Eleanor | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = Celebrated Irish beauty and Catholic heiress. | DATE OF BIRTH     = 1718 | PLACE OF BIRTH    = | DATE OF DEATH     = 1816 | PLACE OF DEATH    = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Ambrose, Eleanor}} [[Category:1718 births]] [[Category:1816 deaths]] [[Category:18th-century Irish people]] [[Category:19th-century Irish people]] [[Category:Irish women]] [[Category:People from Swords, Dublin]]</text></page>",

"<page><title>Wikipedia:WikiProject Wikisource/Wikisource linkfarms</title><text>Welcome to the linkfarm section of Wikiproject Wikisource. This page is intended to co-ordinate work towards the goal of reducing unnecessary linkfarms at the end of Wikipedia articles.  ==Objective== Per [[WP:LINKFARM]], "excessive lists can dwarf articles and detract from the purpose of Wikipedia."  Some articles, however, have long lists of links to texts on Wikisource.  This is unnecessary as subject specific lists of texts can be created on Wikisource as portals.  The list on Wikipedia can therefore be replaced with a single link to the portal on Wikisource.  NB: This has the advantage of also reducing the use of Wikisource citations as external links.  ==Method== # Create the portal on Wikisource. #* The name of the portal is likely to be the same as the article, although this may vary. #* Follow the help documentation at [[Wikisource:Help:Portals]]. # Cut and paste the links from Wikipedia to Wikisource. #* Some changes will need to be made but a lot of the existing link information should still be valid.  Citation template on Wikipedia with the name ''Cite X'' can often be replaced with equivalent templates with the name ''X link''. # Add the {{tl|wikisource portal}} template to the Wikipedia article instead of the linkfarm. # Index the new Wikisource portal as appropriate on [[Wikisource:Portal:Index]].</text></page>",

Pavlo Denys Hayda''' ({{lang-uk|Павло Денис Гайда}}) (October 22, 1964 &ndash; September 4, 2007) was a [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]] priest, most notable for being the pastor of [[St. Joseph the Betrothed Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] between 1995 and 2007. He preached extensively on the subject of [[History_of_theology#Byzantine_theology|Eastern Theology]] and its practical application in a modern lifestyle, especially in ministering to the Church's youth. Notably, he was the first priest of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] to be legally ordained in Ukraine following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and emergence of the Church from its [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church#20th century: persecution and internationalization|underground]].  <ref>{{cite web|title=Priest Through the Years|url=http://www.stjosephukr.com/index.php/id/56|publisher=St. Joseph Ukrainian Catholic Church|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>  ==Early life== Fr. Pavlo was born in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]] on October 22, 1964 to Roma and Ihor Hayda. He grew up with three older siblings, Borys, Marko and Roman.  In his youth, Fr. Pavlo was an active member in the Ukrainian community as a member of the Ukrainian scouting organization [[Plast]]. Fr. Pavlo finished grade school and [[Fairfield College Preparatory School]] in [[Easton, Connecticut]]. In 1982 Fr. Pavlo spent the summer in [[Harvard]], studying Ukrainian language and preparing for his college studies. Initially having the desire to study engineering, Fr. Pavlo felt a vocation to enter the priesthood, following in the footsteps of forebearers who were priests, going back over four hundred years.  ==Education== In 1982 Fr. Pavlo entered [[St. Basil's College Seminary]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] where he completed his [[Bachelor of Arts]] Degree in Philosophy. Shortly after completing his studies at St. Basil's, in May 1986, Fr. Pavlo entered the [[St. Sophia Seminary for Priestly Formation]] and began his [[Master's degree|master’s]] studies at [[Catholic Theological Union]] in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]]. Before completing his Masters Degree in [[Divinity]] in 1991, Fr. Pavlo would take an active part in many aspects of the Ukrainian community, specifically church community. He taught religion at the Saturday School of Ukrainian Studies "Ridna Shkola", actively worked on the committee commemorating the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Millennium of Ukrainian Christianity]] and Ukrainian Youth for Christ Conventions, as well as sang in many choirs. It was through his work at Sts. [[Volodymyr]] and Olha Parish that he met his wife Christine. The couple married in May 1991.  [[Image:Lviv - Cathedral of Saint George 01.JPG|thumb|[[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv]]]]  Without a free church in Ukraine, there was great difficulty for a married man to get [[ordained]]. After a brief visit with [[Archbishop Volodymyr Sterniuk]] in Chicago, Fr. Pavlo and his wife accepted an invitation to live and work in Ukraine. Fr. Pavlo and his wife traveled to [[Lviv, Ukraine]], in February 1992. By the grace of God and the hand of Patriarch [[Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky]], Pavlo Denys Hayda was ordained to the holy priesthood in [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] on March 29, 1992. Ordination at St. George's Cathedral is not only significant for Fr. Pavlo because it is the seat of the worldwide Ukrainian Catholic Church, but also because his grandfather Jaroslav Kniahynyckyj (a descendant of St. [[Job of Manyava]])was also ordained in St. George's Cathedral 65 years earlier by the hand of [[Andrej Sheptytskyj]].  ==Ministry== Within days of his ordination, Fr. Pavlo was assigned to his first parish. [[St. Paraskevia]]{{disambiguation needed|date=August 2012}} in [[Kalynivka, Ukraine]]. This assignment was brief, for shortly before the birth of their first son Julian, Fr. Pavlo returned to Chicago. In October 1992 Fr. Pavlo was assigned to his second parish, that of [[St. Josaphat]] in [[Munster, Indiana]], where he served the community of approximately 150 families for nearly three years.  By July 1995, change was again in the air. The day after the baptism of their second son Zachary, Fr. Pavlo and his family moved to St. Joseph Parish on the [[Northwest Side, Chicago|northwest side of Chicago]]. It is here in 2004 that the birth of twins, Elias and Dymytrij, occurred. His service at St. Joseph Parish have been very active, in particular with the re-activation of the [[Sts. Cyril and Methodius]] Youth Group the completion of the interior painting of the church and the re-painting of the domes. In addition to parish work, Fr. Pavlo has continued to work within the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Chicago|St. Nicholas Eparchy]] and community. He has worked actively to organize Eparchial Conferences, [[clergy]] retreats and has held the position of [[Presbyteral Council]] member and Consultor to the [[bishop]]. Fr. Pavlo also dedicated his Saturday mornings to teaching religion at St. Joseph Ridna Shkola.  ==Death== [[File:Fr. pavlo hayda open casket.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Funeral Services for Fr. Pavlo]]  On September 4, 2007 Fr. Pavlo was riding his bicycle eastbound in the 1900 block of East [[Oakton Street]] in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]] from dropping off his car to be repaired. At about 11 a.m. he collided with an [[SUV]] as it was exiting the driveway of an apartment complex.  Fr. Pavlo Hayda was pronounced dead at 12:27 p.m. at [[Advocate Lutheran General Hospital]] in [[Park Ridge, Illinois]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Fr. Pavlo Hayda|url=http://www.byzcath.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=251596|publisher=The Byzantine Forum|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Death by Driver Once Again|url=http://chicagoist.com/2007/09/06/death_by_driver.php|publisher=Chicagoist|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>   On September 7, 2007 Fr. Pavlo's body [[lie in state|lay in state]] under the main dome of the Church; an estimated 4,000 people are said to have filed past his [[casket]] in that day. That night a traditional funeral [[Parastas]] was held with various dignitaries and international guests as well as an Honor Guard from The [[Ukrainian American Veterans]], the [[Knights of Columbus]], and Ukrainian Scouting Organization, [[Plast]]. On September 8, 2007 Divine Liturgy and Funeral were served. Fr. Pavlo was then interred at [[St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cemetery]] with military and scouting honors. Notably, a [[New Orleans]] [[jazz band]] played a traditional jazz dirge during a procession to the cemetery in the same fashion as that of a [[jazz funeral]].  ==See also== *[[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] *[[Western Ukrainian Clergy]] *[[St. Joseph the Betrothed Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] *[[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Chicago]]  ==References== {{Reflist}}  {{Persondata | NAME              = Hayda, Pavlo | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = American priest | DATE OF BIRTH     = October 22, 1964 | PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Battle Creek, Michigan]] | DATE OF DEATH     = September 4, 2007 | PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Park Ridge, Illinois]] }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Hayda, Pavlo}} [[Category:1964 births]] [[Category:2007 deaths]] [[Category:People from Battle Creek, Michigan]] [[Category:Members of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] [[Category:Eastern Catholic priests]] [[Category:Road accident deaths in Illinois]] [[Category:20th-century Christian clergy]] [[Category:21st-century Christian clergy]]</text></page>",

Kelly]] and Jim Swaffield and written by Kelly based on the [[Trapped in the Closet (Chapter 1)|song of the same name]]. Released in August 21, 2007, the film follows protagonist Sylvester, a man who in order not to get caught cheating decides to hide in his affair's closet.  == Plot == ;Chapter 13 The chapter initially starts with Sylvester and Twan in Sylvester's car though it is not clear at first where they are going. When Sylvester tells Twan to be on his best behavior and reminds Twan about how he got sent to jail, Twan says it "was because of Roxanne and that bitch Tina", which Sylvester remembers his wife mentioning their names on chapter five. The scene soon cuts to Rosie the nosy neighbor and her husband Randolph (played by R. Kelly), who argue over Rosie spying on other neighbors. The argument ends when the scene cuts back to Sylvester explaining to Twan that he has to collect money from someone, he tells Twan to leave the car in drive and be on the lookout and enters a restaurant. An hour goes by with no sign of Sylvester.  ;Chapter 14 In chapter fourteen, it is revealed that apparently Sylvester and Cathy, who shows up in a blond wig and black dress, had made a deal for Sylvester to get caught by her pastor husband Rufus but the deal had apparently backfired, not only by Cathy's realization that Sylvester and her best friend Gwendolyn were married but also due to Cathy not wanting to end her marriage to Rufus, with Cathy later admitting she had changed her mind on the deal. When Sylvester threatens to leave, Cathy tries to explain the reasons why. A waitress comes by and offers them drinks. Sylvester looks at the waitress thinking to himself that she looked familiar. Meanwhile outside at Sylvester's car, Twan gets a call from a friend (only shown by a close up of his mouth) about Tina, telling him Tina had stopped [[prostitution|prostituting]] and was working at a "legit" place. He later tells Twan that Tina was working at the same restaurant where Sylvester is at with Cathy. Back at the restaurant, Sylvester notices the waitress but can't think from where, until he sees her name tag which says "Tina". Sylvester then says he wants to talk to her but she gets scared and calls for her friend/co-worker Roxanne, who runs out with a frying pan. After Tina breaks a beer bottle and makes karate-styled moves saying to Sylvester that she and Roxanne take [[Tae Bo]], Cathy and the rest of the patrons leave quickly, leaving Sylvester alone with Tina and Roxanne. Just as Tina and Roxanne are about to attack, Twan comes busting through the door threatening them.  ;Chapter 15 With Twan, Sylvester, Tina and Roxanne in the now-empty restaurant, Twan seeks revenge on Tina and Roxanne on his arrest three years ago. Sylvester tries calming Twan down reminding him he's on [[house arrest]] and that a violent outburst would lead to a more serious time in prison. After convincing Twan to let him talk to them, Sylvester approaches the two ladies and ask them what had happened on the day of his arrest. Tina and Roxanne explain that they were on a "simple operation" describing a "[[drug trafficking|trip]]" to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Roxanne tells Sylvester that a [[substance intoxication|high]] Twan was swerving on the road and cutting up on the both of them, even turning his music loud playing "[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]]" and screaming "I'm Rick James, bitch!" Tina explains that as soon as that happened, they heard not only police squad cars but also a helicopter. Twan's car breaks down and all three are eventually arrested. In the interrogation room, the police tell the women that Twan blamed the drug deal on them in order to save his own skin. It is then when Roxanne tells Twan she turned him in. Roxanne says Tina protected him because Tina was pregnant with Twan's baby at the time.  ;Chapter 16 Sylvester, stunned at first at the news of Tina having Twan's child, congratulates Twan on the news but Twan is not convinced, accusing Tina of lying on him, which causes Tina's eye to twitch, which had started when Sylvester had first approached her near the end of chapter 14. When Sylvester asks Roxanne about it, Roxanne explains a [[pimp]] had hit Tina in the eye a year ago and that she's had bad nerves ever since. Twan then pulls Sylvester to the side and begins wondering if he is really the father of Tina's child, Sylvester convinces him that a child would calm him down. When Twan tells Tina that he wants to make this work, Roxanne kisses Tina and reveals they are lovers. She said ''Im fucking her now''.  ;Chapter 17 Stunned at the news of Roxanne and Tina being lovers, a frustrated Sylvester points his gun at the both of them, but soon stops because of his tolerance to [[lesbian]]ism, while Twan kept egging him to shoot them. Sylvester tries to get Twan to leave the restaurant. It's only after Twan threatens Tina and Roxanne that he will buy a gun and come back for them later that Sylvester finally convinces Twan to leave.  ;Chapter 18 Back at the car as they drive away, Twan is still angry over seeing Roxanne and Tina together, despite Sylvester's efforts to calm him down. Around this time, Sylvester gets a phone call from Gwendolyn, who tells him that his parents, O'Dale and Myrna, got into it and Myrna had O'Dale put in jail. The scene then shifts to Rufus' church where he is leading the worship song, "Jesus Will Work It Out", with Reverend Mosley James Evans and the Peace Within Choir. When the song reaches a climax, Rufus gets a phone call and excuses himself to his office. It's Chuck, who's crying and upset over not seeing Rufus since the incident in the earlier chapters. Rufus and Chuck argue when Cathy walks in Rufus' office. When Cathy asks Rufus who was on the phone, Chuck, who can be heard accidentally on speaker phone, cries out for Rufus, which angers Cathy and the two argue before Rufus sends Cathy out to deal with the situation. Rufus then tries to let Chuck come see him so they can talk but Chuck refuses. Rufus then tells Chuck that he wants to stay married because he loves his wife & is a Pastor as the reason he doesn't wanna see Chuck anymore, which angers Chuck, who threatens to reveal their relationship. When Rufus again tries to get Chuck to come see him, Chuck reveals he is recovering at a hospital.  ;Chapter 19 Reverend Mosley James Evans and the Peace Within Choir attempt to persuade Pimp Lucius, a [[pimp]] with a severe stuttering problem, to stop pimping and to turn his life around. As the choir sings "you can do it Pimp Lucius," Lucius pretends to accept the offer and leaves the church.  However, he then tells his pimpin' partner, Bishop Craig, that he is never going to "s-s-s-s-s-stop p-p-p-pimpin," because "p-p-p-pimpin's for life." Then he tells Bishop Craig "now let's get this mmm-mmmmm money."  ;Chapter 20 This chapter shows Rosie the Nosy Neighbor's house where Rosie is seen in her chair reading the [[Bible]] when her husband Randolph comes in shouting, "he's got the package!" to Rosie. Unwilling to listen to first, when Randolph tells her he has news on the pastor (Rufus), she demands what was going on with him. After a few bickers, Randolph tells Rosie the story: while working as a janitor for the church, Randolph hears Rufus coming into the office. Randolph hid in the closet and unintentionally overheard the conversation seen in chapter eighteen among Chuck, Rufus and Cathy. After relaying the story, Rosie asks Randolph why he had said the pastor had "the package", Randolph says that Chuck told him he was at the hospital. Rosie immediately decides to inform the masses, despite Randolph's protests. The chapter ends with Randolph sitting on the couch, falling asleep.  ;Chapter 21 Sylvester and Twan go to visit an apparent [[mobster]] named Joey. Sylvester informs Joey of some job that could get them a lot of money. While there, Joey accuses Twan of being a cop, as well as calling him "[[LL Cool J|LL Fool J]]," deeply offending Twan. Sylvester, trying to defuse the situation, asks Twan to wait outside the office while he and Joey discuss business. As Twan leaves the room, he remarks, "I'll be listening from the outside." Joey replies, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. [[Mama Said Knock You Out (song)|Mama said knock you out]], fuck outta here." While waiting outside, Twan has a nightmare of Sylvester and him in the same situation, being pointed at with guns. In the end, Sylvester wakes Twan up, then Joey and Sylvester say their goodbyes, and Joey asks Sylvester to tell Gwendolyn he says hello, as their deal is sealed.  ;Chapter 22 The scene opens to O'Dale and Myrna's voicemail (Sylvester's mother) and eventually fades into the middle of the voicemail box where the narrator (Kelly) says, "and now the rumor." Throughout a series of phone conversations among all of the original characters from Chapters 1-12 and those introduced in Chapter 13-22, rumors of "The Package" circulate. Because Chuck has it, it has possibly been passed to Rufus, to his wife Cathy, to Sylvester, and to Gwendolyn. In addition, Bridget realizes that James knows both Chuck and Rufus, though he tried to hide it from her earlier, suggesting he may be on the "[[Down-low (MSM)|down-low]]" with Chuck as well. Gwendolyn also cheated on Sylvester with James however she used a condom as revealed in Chapter 4. This would put Bridget, Big Man, and James at serious risk. Lastly, Pimp Lucius gets a similar concerned call from an unidentified woman (who may have gotten "The Package" from Big Man, and subsequently passed it to Pimp Lucius).  == References == *{{IMDb title|1042567|Trapped in the Closet Chapters 13-22}}  {{R.

"Exy" Johnson''' (August 17, 1909, in Rochester N.Y. – November 9, 2004) was an American author, lecturer, adventure, and sail training pioneer.  Throughout her life she completed many sailing feats including sailing around the world seven times while training younger sailors.  ==Early life==  Electa "Exy" Johnson was born in [[Rochester, New York]] on August 17, 1909.<ref name=fold3>{{cite web|title=Electa S Johnson|url=http://www.fold3.com/page/1893870_electa_s_johnson/|publisher=Fold3}}</ref>  She attended Smith College and then  [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=fold3 /> Exy Johnson’s sailing experience started after her years in college when she boarded a schooner set to sail around [[France]].

Exy and Irving did not sail during the war.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|title=Electra Johnson, 95; With Husband, Told of Adventures Sailing Around Globe 7 Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/04/local/me-johnson4|newspaper=LA Times|date=12/4/04}}</ref>  Each tour had a new crew of two dozen fresh recruits ready to learn.<ref name=latimes /> Each voyage would visit 120 ports of call and crew members paid $4,860 to participate. Each tour lasted about 18 months after which Exy and Irving would take 18 months off.<ref name=latimes /> During their breaks, they would work on their books, lecture students, and work on films. The books they wrote are listed below. Also if Exy and Irving had free time during their summer off they would show young [[Girl Scouts of the USA|girl scouts]] how to sail by sailing up and down the coast of [[New England]].<ref name=seattle />  Exy and Irving used different types of sailing vessels for training their crew mates. The first ship they had was a 92-foot wooden schooner named ''Yankee''.<ref name=fold3 /> The next ship they used for training was a 96 foot steel [[brigantine]] also named ''Yankee''.<ref name="fold3" /> Their final ship was a 50-foot [[ketch]] named ''Yankee''. This ketch was primarily for their own personal use after their years of training.<ref name=fold3 /> In her lifetime, Exy sailed further than the distance to the moon.<ref name=thelog />  ==Later years==  Exy and Irving had two children, Robert and Arthur. As soon as the boys could walk they boarded ship and began to sail with the family.<ref name=thelog />  After 1958, when Exy and Irving were done teaching young people how to sail, they went on their own personal tour from 1958 to 1975. On this they mainly sailed their 50 foot ketch and toured around exploring the European water ways.<ref name=seattle />  Exy finally retired from sailing in 1975 where she and her husband settled down in [[Hadley, Massachusetts]] on a farm that Irving had grown up on.<ref name=fold3 /> In 1991 Irving died but Exy kept working to keep the legacy alive. The Los Angeles Maritime Institute has recently honored Irving and Exy by naming their twin brigantines for use in their award winning Topsail Youth program after them. The doyenne of modern sail training, Exy Johnson would personally oversee the christening ceremonies of the vessels she was instrumental in constructing prior to her death in 2004.<ref name=latimes />  [[File:Exy.jpg|thumb|The tall ship Exy Johnson named in her honor]]  ==Books==  ===''Yankee Sails Across Europe''=== Exy and Irving trip in the European water ways took them over 10,000 miles in the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seas.

They then sailed westward to [[Sicily]] and [[Elba]].  They then sailed in [[Switzerland]] after they sailed down into the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]].

"<page><title>Americans Battling Communism</title><text>'''Americans Battling Communism, Inc.''' (ABC) was an [[anti-communist]] organization created following an October 1947 speech by [[Pennsylvania]] Judge [[Blair Gunther]] that called for an "ABC movement" to educate America about [[communism]]. [[Charter]]ed in November 1947 by [[Harry Alan Sherman]], a local lawyer active in various anti-communist organizations, the group took part in such activities as [[blacklisting]] by disclosing the names of people suspected of being communists. Its members included local judges and lawyers active in the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy-era]] prosecution of communists.  ==History== Americans Battling Communism, Inc.

The first operational line was opened on 20 April 1935. Soon after that six more lines were opened, bringing the total network length to 23&nbsp;km.<ref name="skgt history"/>   During the communist era, the bus fleet consisted mainly of [[Ikarus Bus|Ikarus]] and Bulgarian-made [[Chavdar]] buses. After the political changes in 1989, however, the fleet has gradually been modernised.  ==Lines== As of October 2013, the following bus lines in Sofia are in service: <div style="height:10em; overflow:auto; border: 0px solid #088"> {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center" |- !rowspan=1|Line !rowspan=1|Route |- |1 |Autostation Geo Milev — Kokalyansko hanche // Kokalyane |- |3 |Autostation Geo Milev — Dolni Pasarel |- |4 |Mladost-1 — Kokalyane inn |- |5 |Autostation Geo Milev — Dolni Lozen |- |6 |Autostation Geo Milev — German |- |7 |Iskar train station - (BRC) - Gorni Lozen |- |8 |German - Krivina |- |9 |Autobase Iskar - Gurko str. |- |10 |Busmantsi — D.

It was active as a military base between 1936–2008, from 2012-onwards part of the barracks has converted to new rôle as additional academic buildings and student accommodation for the [[University of Würzburg]]  ==History== The garrison's origins begin in 1936 when '''Fliegerhorst Würzburg''' was established for the Luftwaffe as an operational base.  It had an all-way grass landing/takeoff area where aircraft simply were directed into the wind for takeoffs and landings.  Its use during World War II is undetermined.     Würzburg and its airfield was captured by the [[United States Army]] in April 1945 as part of the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]].  The airfield was repaired by IX Engineering Command, [[Ninth Air Force]] into an Army Air Forces advanced Landing Ground, designated R-24.  IX Air Service Command units used the airfield as a casualty evacuation and combat resupply airfield.  After the German Capitulation, Air Force units moved out of the field and the facility was turned over to the United States Army as an occupation garrison.  For over 60 years, the facility, renamed Leighton Barracks after CPT John A. Leighton, Commanding Officer, Company G, 10th Armored Infantry Battalion, 4th Armored Division, who was killed in action July 18, 1944. American troops occupied the airfield on Easter, 1945. Leighton Barracks now served as headquarters for the 1st Infantry Division, along with subordinate military intelligence, signal, and maintenance units.  The former Luftwaffe/AAF airfield was reduced to a helipad, known as  Leighton Army Airfield (Heliport).  The garrison was closed in 2008 and returned to German control.  ==References== * Johnson, David C.

It aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on May 2, 2012 and was written by Paul Corrigan & Brad Walsh and directed by [[Michael Spiller]].  ==Plot== Phil ([[Ty Burrell]]) wants to buy a new car and he takes his friend Andre ([[Kevin Hart (actor)|Kevin Hart]]) with him who convinces him to buy a two-seat convertible instead of his regular [[Cadillac|Cadillac.]] Despite his fear of Claire's ([[Julie Bowen]]) reaction, he decides to do it anyway. Phil gets back home in his new car. Luke ([[Nolan Gould]]) is excited seeing it but he asks if mom would be OK with it, so does Alex ([[Ariel Winter]]). Haley ([[Sarah Hyland]]) is also excited seeing the car because she believes her dad bought if for her since he is too old for that car. Surprisingly Claire does not criticize Phil's decision and hopes he will realize buying the convertible was a mistake on his own.  Due to the convertible only being a two-seater, Phil is forced to switch cars with Claire for work. Phil has to also drive/pick up the kids from school because he has the big car. Phil is mad at the fact he had to switch cars with Claire but he soon realizes that driving the kids to school and picking them up, leads to learning things about them.  Claire decides to ditch her chores and to take the convertible to the coast for some time to herself to calm down. She soon loses the keys on the beach and Phil later arrives with a spare. The two spend time together and agree to make time for one another from now on.  Cam ([[Eric Stonestreet]]) and Mitchell ([[Jesse Tyler Ferguson]]) decide to take Lily ([[Aubrey Anderson-Emmons]]) to a ride with the subway to the Chinatown but they lose her favorite stuffed rabbit. They try and get Lily to choose a new favorite out of her other toys, but she refuses. Cam and Mitchell are therefore forced to go to desperate lengths to get the stuffed rabbit back, including putting up fliers in the subway and offering a reward for its safe return. They soon decide that Lily will have to deal with her loss when they discover the stuffed animal has been in the care of a homeless man.  Meanwhile, Jay ([[Ed O'Neill]]) is ecstatic to take Gloria ([[Sofía Vergara]]) and Manny ([[Rico Rodriguez (actor)|Rico Rodriguez]]) on a trip to his college reunion as he claims he was considered somewhat of a legend by his fellow students. Jay is irritated when he is forced to drive them there due to Gloria's refusal to ride in a small airplane. On their way there, one of the tires punctures and they are once again forced to find an alternative way to travel to the reunion. Gloria is hesitant to go and wants to return home until she realizes Jay is so excited to go because he wants to show his new family off to his old friends, who all used to think that Jay would not amount to much. Gloria agrees to go with him, happy to play the trophy wife role.  ==Reception==  === Ratings === In its original American broadcast, "Planes, Trains and Cars" was watched by 10.06 million; slightly down from the previous episode, with an adult 18-49 rating/share of 4.0/11.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/05/03/wednesday-final-ratings-american-idol-svu-survivor-modern-family-antm-adjusted-up-dont-trust-the-b-adjusted-down/132366/|title = Wednesday Final Ratings: 'American Idol', 'SVU', 'Survivor', 'Modern Family', & 'ANTM' Adjusted Up, 'Don't Trust the B' Adjusted Down|date = May 3, 2012|publisher = TV by the Numbers|last = Kondolojy|first = Amanda}}</ref>  === Reviews === The episode receive mixed reviews from critics.  Wyner C of ''Two Cents TV'' gave a good review to the episode saying that it was awesome. "This was an awesome episode!!! The first 15 minutes had so many one-liners!

Ziemba of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste Magazine]]'' gave the episode 6.6/10 saying that the episode was overall "mediocre". She criticized the character of Gloria, stating that "we know that Gloria has often used her, ahem, assets to get what she wants, but it’s a little degrading to watch her objectified". Ziemba was also critical of Manny's role in the episode. She said "Manny wasn't quite himself either, turning from a sensitive old soul, who’s wise beyond his years, into a snotty brat".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/05/modern-family-review-planes-trains-and-cars-episod.html|title = Modern Family Review: "Planes, Trains and Cars" (Episode 3.21)|date = May 3, 2012|publisher = Paste Magazine|last = Ziemba|first = Christine}} </ref>  Michael Adams of ''411mania'' gave the episode 7/10. "I liked Mitchell this week. [...] The Cam/Mitchell story was minimal, however, it was very funny and touching and Mitch had a lot of great lines.

I think even claiming the organization is notable runs afoul of [[WP:CRYSTALBALL]], but I'd be willing to give an article on the organization a chance.  The coverage on this specific event is pretty much routine sports coverage (except for the ESPN article--which would make a good start for an article on the organization). [[User:Papaursa|Papaursa]] ([[User talk:Papaursa|talk]]) 18:55, 6 June 2012 (UTC) '''Rename to 'List of Invicta FC events', then Keep''' Whilst I do disagree with the concept, Invicta's first event is notable, and with the clear sign of them putting on regular shows I do not see why this information should be deleted, so if by doing the same thing as the UFC events will save it, then I'm up for it. The 2012 in UFC Events page somehow passes for notability despite the messy page and the exact same sources for the omnibus page as to the individual pages, and I believe this concept would work for Invicta. I also think that creating a page for [[Invicta Fighting Championships]] is also needed very soon for any future of this system, for without it the possibility of being nominated for deleted can still happen. [[User:Pound4Pound|Pound4Pound]] ([[User talk:Pound4Pound|talk]]) 08:27, 12 June 2012 (UTC)  It is worth pointing out as well that the Invicta FC 2 event has been added to the page already, so the change of name should happen, then we can discuss with the page creator about assisting with creating a much-needed [[Invicta Fighting Championships]] page.

"<page><title>Filial mourning (East Asia)</title><text>{{multiple issues| {{no footnotes|date=May 2012}} {{unreferenced|date=May 2012}} }}  '''Filial mourning''' ({{zh|t=丁憂|s=丁忧|p=dīngyōu}}) refers to a bureaucratic norm, practiced since the [[Han dynasty]], whereby officials of the imperial government were obliged to resign their posts and return to their home upon the death of a parent or grandparent.  ==Description==  The meaning of the phrase literally means 'to encounter worries/loss', ie. bereavement. Once used to refer to all forms of mourning for one's parents, it evolved in meaning to refer only to the practice of officials resigning their posts for mourning.  The roots of the practice lie in the [[Confucianist]] focus on filial piety as a key virtue of government, and thus was instituted during the [[Western Han dynasty]], when Confucianism first became the official ideology of the empire. During this period, banqueting, marriage, official activities and participation in the [[Imperial Examinations]] are all proscribed. The length of the mourning period is nominally three years, though in practice it has been described as being between twenty-five to twenty-seven months; this is also in line with Confucian prescriptions, since it takes three years for a human child to be fully weaned. At the end of the period, officials will be returned to the same rank as their last previously served post.  Nonetheless, given the length of the mandatory mourning and the tight restrictions on political or public activity, this practice often had a negative effect on the career of officials. Measures did exist to allow the government to recall an official in mourning; this is often applied to key officials in the bureaucracy, who are unable to leave their duties immediately as prescribed, or in times of emergency. On the other hand, failure to report a deceased parent and submit to filial mourning was an offence, and officials were liable to be impeached upon discovery.  Even the [[Chinese Emperor|Emperor]] was subject to filial mourning, though his indispensability to administrative duties means he need only mourn for 27 days, instead of months.

Formed in 2009, the group consists of vocalist/DJ/producer Carey James Balboa and DJ Leonardo Campo. They have contributed much to the growing Latin music scene in Nashville, Tennessee, providing more opportunities for fans of Latin music to gather.  The group also produces original material, including such singles as "Chico Malo" (featuring Jiggy Drama) and "Intocable" (feat. Shungu), which have placed on the Colombian radio rotation.  == History ==  === Formation ===  Carey James Balboa met Leonardo Campo in early 2009 at a party in Nashville, Tennessee where the two discovered they shared a deep love for Latin music and a desire to fill a much needed void for musical events for the growing Latino Nashville community. They soon began hosting monthly Latin parties, which quickly became one of the largest monthly Latin music parties in the Southeastern United States.  [[Image:Colombian Party Cartel. Photo by Ellen Ordóñez for Colombian Party Cartel.jpg|thumb|En Fuego Party in Nashville, TN]]  In 2011, The Colombian Party Cartel also began hosting a weekly Latin music radio program on Vanderbilt University’s WRVU. The show featured such guests as [[Michael Stuart]], [[El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico]] and [[Angel & Khriz]].  === "La Murga De Colombia" ===  The first single by CPC was "La Murga de Colombia", a reggaeton track released in 2010 in which Balboa sampled and recorded a remake of the salsa classic "La Murga" originally recorded by [[Willie Colón]]/[[Héctor Lavoe]]. It was recorded at [[Quad Studios Nashville|Quad Studio A in Nashville]].  <br /> {{listen |pos=left  | filename     = La Murga De Colombia.ogg  | title        = "La Murga De Colombia" (2010)  | description  = "La Murga De Colombia)  | format       = [[Ogg]] }}  === "Chico Malo" (feat. Jiggy Drama) ===  The duo’s second single was an original [[Merengue music|merengue]] track, "Chico Malo", which was recorded with Colombian urban artist [[:es:Jiggy Drama|Jiggy Drama]]. Released in Spring of 2011, the track was included on El Ritmo Records’ mix-tape “Trasno-Show”. It was recorded at the Blackbird Studio D in Nashville by Latin Grammy winner David Hall ([[Ricardo Arjona]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Kenny Chesney]]) and was mixed by engineer Dave Clauss ([[Shakira]],  [[Justin Bieber]], [[U2]],  Quincy Jones) in NYC. The bass was provided by David Santos ([[Neville Brothers]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Elton John]]) and the keys by Rony Jay ([[Sonora Carruseles]]).

[[User:LittleJerry|LittleJerry]] ([[User talk:LittleJerry|talk]]) 23:42, 6 July 2012 (UTC)  ;Comments by Cryptic C62  * Some of the section titles are a bit wonky. I've never seen the phrase ''Life history'' in the context of taxonomy (or any other subject, for that matter). What about "ecology"? I assume that ''Activies'' is supposed to be "Activities", but even this is not a particularly clear description of the section's contents. ::Changed "life history" to "ecology". What do you suggest for a  new name for "Activities"? [[User:LittleJerry|LittleJerry]] ([[User talk:LittleJerry|talk]]) 17:44, 20 July 2012 (UTC) :::Well, the subsection doesn't seem to really focus on any particular type of behavior, it's just ''Behavior'' minus ''Spacing'', ''Foraging'', and ''Reproduction''. Perhaps this section shouldn't be a subsection at all, but should instead serve as the first few paragraphs of the ''Behavior'' section. ::::Done. [[User:LittleJerry|LittleJerry]] ([[User talk:LittleJerry|talk]]) 23:05, 25 July 2012 (UTC) * <s>The last paragraph in ''Distribution and status'' is problematic.

Do we have any stats or estimates on how many anteaters were alive in 2000 and 2010? I think that would be more informative than the percent difference. Also, if such numbers aren't available, a much more natural phrasing would be: "Between 2000 and 2010, the total population had declined by 30 percent." ::Couldn't find any stats so changed to suggested sentence.

[[User:LittleJerry|LittleJerry]] ([[User talk:LittleJerry|talk]]) 23:05, 25 July 2012 (UTC) * In the first paragraph of ''Reproduction'', there are three consecutive sentences that start with "During".

The area's first settlers arrived in 1785, when it was still part of [[Virginia]], and Milton was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] four years later.  River commerce was always an important part of the local economy: across the river from Milton is the city of [[Madison, Indiana|Madison]], which was an early commercial center for [[Indiana]], and a river ferry between the two settlements was started in 1804.  The two cities have been connected by the [[Milton-Madison Bridge]] since 1929.<ref name=mps>Johnson, William Gus.

Their new construction was typically [[vernacular architecture|vernacular]] in style,<ref name=mps />{{rp|12}} in contrast to the high [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style that was popular before the Civil War.<ref name=mps />{{rp|11}}  Unlike in previous decades, this period's new buildings often employed various small decorations, many of which were prefabricated;<ref name=mps />{{rp|4}} Ginn's Furniture is typical of this style, featuring small elements such as ornamentation on the windows and a [[cornice]] with [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]].  Unfortunately, most of Milton's historic architecture has not survived to the present.  Significant floods inundated the city repeatedly in the late nineteenth century, and almost everything in its downtown was destroyed.<ref name=mps />{{rp|5}}  ==Architecture== Ginn's Furniture was erected on an unknown date in the last quarter of the 19th century.  Built of brick on a [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] of [[limestone]],<ref name=nomination>Johnson, William Gus.

Individuals may enter the building through either of two entrances in the facade or through three doors on the side; the latter are equipped with [[sidelight]]s.  The entire building is covered by a [[hip roof]], which is pierced by a [[chimney]] near each end.  Inside, the most impressive element is a pressed tin ceiling, which is original to the building.<ref name=nomination />  ==Preservation== In the early 1980s, Kentucky Heritage Council officials travelled throughout Trimble County to conduct a survey of its older buildings for [[historic preservation]] purposes.  As a result of the survey, thirty-three buildings and one [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]] in the county were nominated to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as part of a [[multiple property submission]],<ref name=mps />{{rp|19}} and all but one of them were added to the Register in 1983 and 1984.<ref name=nris />  By that time, just six pre-1937 commercial buildings in the downtown were still in existence, including Ginn's Furniture Store.  Accordingly, it was one of the buildings listed on the National Register in 1983, due largely to its place as a rare survivor among the earlier buildings in Milton's floodplain zone.<ref name=mps />{{rp|3}}  Moreover, it was deemed to be the area's most significant building from an architectural point of view — not just downtown, but citywide.<ref name=nomination />  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{National Register of Historic Places}}  [[Category:Buildings and structures in Trimble County, Kentucky]] [[Category:Furniture retailers of the United States]] [[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Trimble County, Kentucky]]</text></page>",

[[London]] was originally supposed to host the Final Four, but it was decided that the 2014 Euroleague Final Four be hold at the [[Mediolanum Forum]], in [[Milan]]. In the championship final game, [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] defeated previous season runners-up [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]] with 98-86 after overtime, and won its sixth Euroleague title in the club history.  ==Allocation== There are three routes to participation in the Euroleague:  * The 14 teams with an A-Licence from the [[2012–13 Euroleague]] based on their [[European national basketball league rankings#Team Ranking|Euroleague Club Ranking]].<ref>[http://www.in-the-game.org/?page_id=7895 In-The-Game.org Euroleague three-year-ranking.]</ref> * The [[2012–13 Eurocup Basketball|2012–13 Eurocup]] winner is given a C-Licence. * 14 places were allocated from a list of 30 teams given a B-Licence ranked according to their [[European national basketball league rankings]] over the last year. 14 teams were given both an A-Licence or C-Licence and a B-Licence. When a country ranking spot has already been assigned to an A-Licence team, the assignation will jump to the next country appearing in the ranking, and their league is ''not'' granted an additional place in the competition. The first 8 of the remaining 16 teams were given places in the regular-season, and the next 6 were given places in the qualifying competition. * If the Eurocup champion is qualified by receiving a B license or some team with it resigns to the competition, a wild card must be given by the Euroleague.  The Euroleague has the right to cancel an A license for one of the following reasons:'''<ref>[http://www.euroleague.net/rs/40240/84bd1f8d-134d-42a0-a8ee-cd688d29aaa2/45c/filename/2012-2013-euroleague-bylaws.pdf 2012–13 Euroleague bylaws]</ref>  ''' *The club has the lowest ranking of all clubs with an A Licence according to the Club Ranking. *The club has ranked among the clubs placed in the bottom half of the national championship final standings. *The club has financial problems. *In [[Liga ACB|the ACB (Spain)]], when the champion and/or the runner-up of the league are teams without an A license. In this case, the A license club with the lowest position will play [[Eurocup Basketball|Eurocup]] in the next season.

I am, however, filing this report to ask for a checkuser in case of sleepers or other accounts. This user has used at least 27 accounts on Serbian Wikipedia, listed [http://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korisnik:Kolega2357/Bele%C5%A1ke here]. As far as I know, they are all indef-blocked there. All of the accounts I have listed have user names which are either the same as, or very similar to, names of some of those Serbian sockpuppets. (Micky02car and Mickyczv02 are the same name respectively in Cyrillic and Roman alphabets, and others must be obvious even to anyone without a knowledge of Cyrillic.) The accounts have very similar interests and editing behaviour, all editing exclusively articles about footballers. Several accounts have edited about an apparently fictitious footballer called "Milos Bozovic" (perhaps fantasies about the editor himself: nine of the Serbian sockpuppets and two of the English ones have names containing "Milos"). For example, ДЕЛИЈЕ СЕВЕР 1989 created the hoax article [[Milos Bozovic]], Milosczv2222 created the hoax article [[Milos Bozovic (footballer born 1990)]], Делије са Севера added bogus information about Milos Bozovic to an article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SV_Werder_Bremen&diff=prev&oldid=503931781 here], and Micky02car did so [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SV_Werder_Bremen&diff=prev&oldid=499284689 here]. There are other similarities in editing too, such as removing mentions of players "on loan" from one club to another: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%BDeljko_Brki%C4%87&diff=prev&oldid=507546928],  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Racing_de_Santander&diff=prev&oldid=510733963], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrija_Kalu%C4%91erovi%C4%87&diff=prev&oldid=510903248], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrija_Kalu%C4%91erovi%C4%87&diff=prev&oldid=511080275], etc. [[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]] ([[User talk:JamesBWatson|talk]]) 14:41, 10 September 2012 (UTC) *I have now found that many more of the Serbian socks have also edited on English WP, several of them are already blocked, and some are globally locked. Other hoax articles include [[Milos Bozovic (goalkeeper)]], [[Miloš Božović (goalkeeper)]], and [[Nikola Božović]]. One of the accounts says "my name is Miloš Božović" on his user page, so that removes any doubt about the hoaxes being vanity pages about himself. I also found that [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Kimiczv02]] deals with the same sockpuppeteer, and should now be moved to here, but I don't have time to do it. I have blocked all the accounts that have edited English WP, except those that I know are globally locked. It would still be worth a CU in case of yet more accounts.

Cocido Montañés is a hot and heavy dish whose origin was in the 17th century and it was cooked to fight against the cold and wet climate in the [[Cantabrian mountains]]. For that reason is most commonly eaten during winter and at the largest meal of the day, lunch. It is usually served as a starter course, but may also be the main course of the meal.  ==Ingredients== Cocido Montañés is made with two vegetal ingredients, dried large [[Common bean#White beans|white beans]] (soaked overnight before use) and [[collard greens]] (''berza'').

''Riptide'' serves as a continuation of the story in 2011's ''Dead Island'', with the original four survivors plus a new survivor arriving on another island in the Banoi archipelago, which has also been overrun by zombies.  ''Dead Island: Riptide'' received mixed reception from reviewers, who cited that the game didn't fix any of its predecessor's problems, nor did it add anything new to the gameplay. A third title and first official sequel for the series, ''[[Dead Island 2]]'', was revealed at [[E3 2014]].  ==Plot== ''Riptide'' takes place immediately after the ending of ''Dead Island'', with the four immune survivors. They cannot be infected with the zombie's bites so they can do whatever they want - ex-[[American football]] player Logan Carter, rapper Sam B, Chinese undercover police officer Xian Mei, and Purna, ex-police officer - along with international terrorist Charon and native Yerema, asymptomatic [[index case|patient zero]] of the Banoi outbreak, landing on a military ship after escaping from the prison island. They are immediately taken into custody by the [[Australian Defence Force]] Colonel Sam Hardy and Frank Serpo, a civilian VIP. Yerema and Charon are taken away separately; Yerema bites one of the ADF soldiers as she is taken away. In the ship's brig, the remaining four meet another immune survivor, ADF Sergeant John Morgan, who claims he was part of a humanitarian effort on a nearby island until Serpo showed up and halted the mission.  Passing out from sedatives applied when they were examined, the player's character wakes up to find the ship overrun with zombies. Serpo flees via helicopter shortly before the ship, out of control, crashes into a rock. The immune regain consciousness on the shore of the island of Palanai and are found by Harlow, a [[World Health Organization|WHO]] researcher, who tells them the zombie infection has spread there as well. After saving a holdout of survivors, they meet Colonel Hardy again; he tells the irate immune that Serpo's organization is interested in weaponizing the [[Kuru (disease)|Kuru]] strain that caused the zombie outbreak and, as with Banoi, a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] strike against Palanai is planned to purge the infection and cover up the evidence.  At Hardy's suggestion, the immune and several other survivors decide to travel to the city of Henderson, hoping the nearby army base may offer help. With no intact bridges or working boats, the survivors instead investigate an underground tunnel to reach a pier. A researcher based in the jungle, Dr. Kessler, tells the immune that he believes the zombie-creating virus mutation was created by exposure to chemical weapons. He warns the player these were stored in the tunnels, and that they could act as a [[mutagen]] to turn the virus in the immune's bodies into something they can no longer suppress.  As the immune clear the tunnels, Harlow exposes a secretly-infected survivor to the chemicals to see the results; the survivor turns into a giant monster, who the immune kill. Shortly afterwards, when attacked by a holdout of escaped prisoners who have seized the pier, the survivors go into an involuntary, prolonged fury. Kessler explains on the phone that this was probably the result of fumes from the chemical weapons acting as a mutagen, but tells them they should be fine if they avoid further exposure. The survivors subsequently reach Henderson, but as they take shelter in a movie theater, Harlow abandons them.  The immune find the military base was overrun and contact Serpo; he tells them there is no nuclear strike planned, that Banoi is fine, that Hardy is not to be trusted, and agrees to send a helicopter to evacuate the survivors. Hardy freely admits he made up the nuclear strike to stir the survivors to action, and in turn insists Serpo is untrustworthy and only intends to evacuate the immune to continue his research. When Serpo's helicopter arrives, Hardy attempts to board it first to prove this. Serpo warns him to let the immune on first, then has him shot and killed. The survivors proceed to shoot the helicopter down.  Finding Serpo alive near the crash site, the immune are told that Harlow is not only immune, but also a terrorist looking to seize data and a vaccine from a quarantine zone. When the survivors storm the lab in the quarantine zone, they find Harlow; she tells them the outbreaks were started deliberately to test the virus, and there is no vaccine. Harlow, however, is in a violent rage, having had the mutagen tested on herself by the lab's staff. Convinced the immune are too dangerous to live, she takes the mutagen again and attacks them, prompting the other immune to inject themselves with it as well to kill her.  When the immune find a boat, they are greeted by Serpo again; he freely admits to orchestrating the outbreaks, but offers the immune medical help if they come with him. The immune instead leave him to the zombies and evacuate the island with the five other survivors in their party. Six days later, their boat washes up on another island, apparently abandoned. As the game ends, growling is heard from the inside of the boat, and the doorknob to the hold is turned open from the inside before the game abruptly ends. The fates of the immune and the other five survivors are left unclear.  ==Marketing and release== The game was first announced in June 2012,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/05/dead-island-riptide-puts-some-spring-back-in-those-zombies-step/ |title= Dead Island Riptide puts some spring back in zombies' steps |first= Jessica |last= Conditt |date= June 5, 2012 |accessdate= April 23, 2013}}</ref> and in September 2012, the first teaser trailer was released.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/dead-island-2/1226117p1.html |title= Dead Island Riptide Trailer Brings the Drama |first= Taylor |last= Cocke |publisher= [[Gamespy]] |date= September 18, 2012 |accessdate= April 23, 2013}}</ref> A music video for a song called "No Room in Hell" was released in November 2012 by rapper Josef "J7" Lord (who in the song is named [[Sam B]] as the main character from ''Dead Island''), for promotion and featured [[Chamillionaire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/11/chamillionaire-no-room-in-hell-rap-dead-island-riptide |title=Chamillionaire on Dead Island: Riptide |publisher=Complex.com |date= |accessdate= January 15, 2013}}</ref> A new trailer released in March 2013 titled "They Thought Wrong" showed new gameplay, characters, and enemies.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.shockya.com/news/2013/03/23/dead-island-riptide-they-thought-wrong-gameplay-trailer/ |title= Dead Island Riptide They Thought Wrong Gameplay Trailer |first= Brent |last= Butler |date= March 23, 2013 |accessdate= April 23, 2013}}</ref>  ===Mutilated torso promotion=== [[File:Dead Island Riptide mutilated female torso statuette by Deep Silver.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The fiberglass statuette as a promotional item with the "Zombie Bait Edition" of the game]] In January 2013, [[Deep Silver]] announced that ''Dead Island: Riptide'' would be available in a "Zombie Bait Edition", which would include a statuette of the bloodily dismembered torso of a bikini-clad woman.

"<page><title>Portal:Anglo-Saxon England/Selected biography/6</title><text><div style="float:left;margin-right:0.9em"> [[Image:Wiglaf name.gif|100px]] </div> '''Wiglaf''' (died 839) was King of [[Mercia]] from 827 to 829 and again from 830 until his death.  His ancestry is uncertain: the 820s were a period of dynastic conflict within Mercia and the genealogy of several of the kings of this time is unknown. Wigstan, his grandson, was later recorded as a descendant of [[Penda of Mercia]], so it is possible that Wiglaf was descended from Penda, one of the most powerful seventh-century kings of Mercia.  Wiglaf succeeded [[Ludeca of Mercia|Ludeca]], who was killed campaigning against [[East Anglia]].  His first reign coincided with the continued rise of the rival [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Wessex]] under [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]].   Egbert drove Wiglaf from the throne in 829, and ruled Mercia directly for a year.  Wiglaf recovered the kingdom in 830, probably by force although it may be that Wiglaf remained subject to Egbert's overlordship.  Mercia never regained the south-eastern kingdoms, but [[Berkshire]] and perhaps [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]] came back into Mercian control.  The causes of the fluctuating fortunes of Mercia and Wessex are a matter of speculation, but it may be that [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] support influenced both Egbert's ascendancy and the subsequent Mercian recovery.  Although Wiglaf appears to have restored Mercia's independence, the recovery was short-lived, and later in the century Mercia was divided between Wessex and the Vikings.  Wiglaf died in about 839, and was probably succeeded by [[Beorhtwulf of Mercia|Beorhtwulf]], though one tradition records his son, [[Wigmund of Mercia|Wigmund]] as having reigned briefly.

Edgerton, who retired as a [[Colonel]], was also credited with being the first pilot ever to fly into a [[thunderstorm]] and with devising the first fire-extinguishing system installed for an aircraft engine. He also helped to organize a civilian pilot-training program and during [[World War II]] he served as executive officer for air operations of the War Department.<ref>"James Edgerton, Air Mail Pioneer: Colonel Who Flew on First Regular Route Dies at 77". ''New York Times'' Oct 30, 1973, p. 46</ref>  During his first Air Mail flight from Philadelphia to Washington Lt. Edgerton flew into a thunderstorm at 10,000 feet. "One instant the airplane became a tremendous [[elevator]], leaping skyward hundreds of feet," Edgerton noted after landing at the Polo Grounds in Washington, "then the bottom promptly falls out, dizzy fall of hundreds of feet. I was attacked by solid waves of air."<ref>[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/airmail/pilot/pilot_army/pilot_army_edgerton_long.html "PILOT STORIES: James C. Edgerton"] Smithsonian Institution National Postal Museum</ref>  Edgerton flew 52 trips over a total of 7,155 miles, spending 107 hours in the air and making only one [[forced landing]] as an Army Air Mail pilot. When the Post Office Department took over flying operations of the Air Mail Service later in 1918, Edgerton stayed with the service eventually becoming the Superintendent of Flying Operations. Later he organized and became Superintendent of the Radio Service of the Post Office Department establishing its first aeronautical radio stations.<ref>[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/airmail/pilot/pilot_army/pilot_army_edgerton.html "PILOT STORIES: James C.

His father was [[Nure Sofi]]. After his father's death, he founded his beylik which was already semiautonomous during his father's reign. [[Seljuks of Rum|Seljuks]] who were their nominal suzerains were defeated by the [[Mongols]] and Karaman had no problem to settle in the northern slopes of [[Toros Mountains]] close to Seljuk capital [[Konya]]. Seljuk sultan, afraid of Karaman's  increasing power, gave him  some towns as [[ikta]] ( fief) . The city of [[Karaman]] (ancient Larende) bears his name. Karaman fought against [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] and expanded his territory.   In 1261 [[Kilij Arslan IV|Kılıç Aslan IV]] of Seljuks more or less regained strength after his elder brother took refuge in [[Byzantine Empire]].(see [[Seljuks in Dobruja]]) He began punishing rebellious tribes. Seeing this restoration as a threat to his beylik and anticipating a blow from the sultan,  Karaman Bey took initiative by a surprise attack to Konya. But he was defeated in the battle of Gevele (west of Konya). Both of his brothers were killed and he escaped to his territory. It is believed that he died shortly after the battle. He was buried in [[Balkusan]] (now a village in [[Ermenek]] district of [[Karaman Province]]) <ref>Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''Türkiye tarihi Cilt I'', AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 p 241</ref> He was succeeded by [[Mehmet I of Karaman|Mehmet I]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{s-start}} {{s-reg}} {{s-bef | before = [[Nure Sofi]] | as = Leader of the [[Karamanids]]}} {{s-ttl | title  = [[Bey]] of [[Karamanids|Karaman]] | years = 1257–1261}} {{s-aft | after  = [[Mehmet I of Karaman|Mehmet I]]}} {{s-end}}  {{History of Turkey topics}} {{Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and Turkish beyliks}}  {{Persondata | NAME              = Karaman Bey | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = Turkic ruler | DATE OF BIRTH     = | PLACE OF BIRTH    = | DATE OF DEATH     = 1261 | PLACE OF DEATH    = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Karaman Bay}} [[Category:Karamanids]] [[Category:1261 deaths]] [[Category:13th-century rulers]] [[Category:Year of birth unknown]]</text></page>",

"<page><title>Launch Time</title><text>{{multiple issues| {{Orphan|date=December 2012}} {{notability|Products|date=December 2012}} }}  '''Launch Time''' is a new concept for handling [[Ethernet]] [[Network packet|packets]] proposed for the [[Linux kernel]]. It is an attempt to add some [[isochronous]] capability to the kernel by hinting at what time a packet should be sent out. When sending a packet to [[Network socket|socket]], an additional [[bit]] (MSG_LAUNCHTIME) is specified in the "sendto" flags field. If this bit is set, then the buffer passed to the socket includes the desired send time or "launch time". The sendto [[syscall]] will shave off the launchtime from the packet and add it to the msghdr passed to the lower layers of the [[network stack]].  The [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] + [[IPv4]]/[[IPv6]] are planned to be extended to support this, and if launchtime is requested, they will try to call a new send message routine in the network driver which allows passing the launchtime parameter, in addition to those of the normal send message present in the driver. Before Launch time is used the network driver will have to be initialized using an [[ioctl]].  ==Support== Very few [[network controller]]s support launchtime today. The [[Intel]] i210 Gigabit Ethernet controller does, but there is no support in the igb driver as of December 2012.  Launch time can be supported in [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] based [[network card]]s, but it is not common for [[TCP offload engine|TCP/IP Offload Engines]] to support launch time. The [[Endace]] [[DAG Technology|DAG]] cards are an exception, but have no support for Linux networking using the normal network stack, only using a proprietary [[Application programming interface|API]].

After serving as an assistant coach for 22 years, Ryan attained his first head coaching job in the NFL with the Jets in 2009. He is the son of former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Arizona Cardinals]] head coach [[Buddy Ryan]] and is the fraternal twin brother of [[Rob Ryan]], [[defensive coordinator]] for the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Upon graduating from [[Southwestern Oklahoma State University]], Ryan spent the next 22 years serving as an assistant coach on different teams at both the college and professional level. At the behest of their head coach [[Brian Billick]], Ryan joined the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in 1999 and spent nine years there. In 2005 he earned the title of defensive coordinator and in 2008 became the assistant head coach. Hours after the Ravens lost to the Steelers in the [[2008–09 NFL playoffs|2008 playoffs]], Ryan accepted a contract offer from the Jets for their vacant head coaching position. He has become well known throughout the league for his outspoken manner, boisterous attitude and success with the Jets, and his teams are highly regarded by critics for their defensive capabilities.

Northwich Victoria Supporters' Trust members were given the opportunity to decide on creating a new football club. It had emerged on the day of the vote that the owner of Northwich Victoria had been declared bankrupt (later annulled) and therefore failed the FA Fit and Proper Persons test.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://palacetrust.org.uk/2012/12/03/supporters-direct-media-briefing-dec-3rd/ | title=Supporters Direct Media Briefing (Dec 3rd) |date=3 December 2012|work=Supporters Direct|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref>  On 29 November 2012 fans attended an open meeting in Northwich, where they chose the name 1874 Northwich for the club.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/sport/1874northwich/10083483.New_Northwich_club_is_named/ | title=Northwich Victoria fans vote for name of a new club set to play its first match next season |last=Simpson|first=Andrew|date=1 December 2012|work=Northwich Guardian|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> In order to avoid legal issues over the new club's name, none of the proposed options presented to fans included the words Vics or Victoria.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cheshire-today.co.uk/sport/vics-fans-vote-name-breakaway-club-1874-northwich | title=Vics fans vote to name breakaway club 1874 Northwich |last=Jowett|first=Andy|date=30 November 2012|work=Cheshire Today|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> The date 1874 was chosen because that is the year in which Northwich Victoria Football Club (known until 1875 as The Northwich Hare and Hounds and Football Club<ref>{{cite news |title=Northwich Hare and Hounds and Football Club |publisher=Northwich Guardian |date=29 Sep 1875}}</ref>) was founded, or at least, when they played their first formal match against Sandicroft College at Comberbach.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.1874northwich.com/history | title=History – 1874 Northwich F.C. |accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> Northwich won the match 1–0, in what was described as a 'not very scientific struggle'.  The name of the club emulates the style of combining an associated date and a town/city, such as [[Germany|German]] sides [[1860 Munich]] and [[1899 Hoffenheim]].  As with the naming of the club, fans were also given the chance to vote on a motto; the [[Cheshire Regiment]] motto 'Ever Glorious' was chosen due to their links with the [[Drill Field]] and the town of Northwich. One of the other options included the Latin translation, 'Semper Gloriosa'.  On 3 January 2013 it was confirmed that the club had been officially registered with the Cheshire FA and had applied to join the [[North West Counties Football League]] in time for the 2013–14 season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nwcfl.com/news-articles.php?id=2581 | title=Applications To Join The NWCFL |last=Templeman|first=Ian|date=3 January 2013|work=[[North West Counties Football League]]|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>  On 25 April 2013 it was announced that former [[Winsford United]] and [[Ashton Athletic]] boss Ian Street would be the club's very first manager.<ref>http://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/sport/1874northwich/10385187.New_boss_has_sights_set_on_success/</ref> On 28 April 2013 Lee Duckworth was named as his assistant.<ref>http://1874northwich.com/assistant</ref>  The team played their first match on 10 July 2013 against local team Lostock Gralam FC, winning 3–1.<ref>http://www.1874northwich.com/fixtures-2013-14 – ''1874 Northwich.

"<page><title>Ndungu Land Commission</title><text>The Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land, which came to be known as the '''"Ndungu Commission"''' after the name of its Chair, Paul Ndungu, was a [[Kenya]] Government Commission established in 2003. The Commission was formulated to inquire into the extra-legal allocation  of public lands and lands reserved for public purpose to private individuals and corporate entities, and to provide recommendations to the Government for the restoration of those lands to their original purpose or other appropriate solutions.<ref>http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=1144028411&pageNo=1</ref>  ==Membership== The Commission as appointed by President [[Mwai Kibaki]] had representatives from civil society, academia, the legal profession, and civil service:<ref>http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/news/june03/2003300601.htm</ref> # Paul Ndiritu Ndungu - (Chairman) # Michael Aronson - (Vice-chairman) # Ahmed Ahmed Abdallah # Davinder Lamba # Ann Kirima # Ishan Kapila # Odenda Lumumba # Winston O.

Urban, State & Ministries’ Land'''  The Commission indicated that numerous methods were used to grab land falling under this category.  * Widespread abuse of presidential discretion with regard to unalienated urban land, with ‘in many instances’ (both) Presidents [[Jomo Kenyatta]] and Daniel arap Moi making grants to land to individuals without any consideration to the public interest, for political reasons, and without proper pursuit of legal procedures, whilst there was also extensive illegal allocation by both former presidents of [[alienated land]] (viz, land which they did not have legal power to allocate).  * Various Commissioners of Lands had made direct grants of government land without any authority from the President. Forged letters and documents were used to allocate land in numerous instances, with many records at the Ministry of Lands and Settlements having been deliberately destroyed. Often, land was sold by grantees without any adherence to the conditions laid down by letters of allotment, and many illegal titles to public land were transferred to third parties, often State Corporations, for massive sums of money.  * Land compulsorily acquired, like that for the proposed Nairobi by-pass, was illegally allocated to individuals and companies, and then often sold on to third parties, whilst land reserved for public purposes such as schools, playgrounds, and hospitals etc. had been sold off in blatant disregard of the law by both the Commissioner of Lands and numerous local authorities.  In summary, the Commission found that the powers vested in the President had been grossly abused by both former Presidents and successive Commissioners of Lands and their deputies over the years, under both previous regimes; there had been ‘unbridled plunder’ (Commission: p.&nbsp;81) of public land by local Councillors and officials; illegal transactions were hugely facilitated by the extensive complicity of professionals (lawyers, surveyors, valuers, physical planners, engineers, architects, land registrars, estate agents and bankers) in the land and property market; and most high profile allocations of public land were made to companies incorporated specifically for that purpose, largely to shield the directors and shareholders of such entities from easy public view. Finally, and interestingly, the Commission found that ‘most illegal allocations of public land took place before or soon after the multiparty general elections of 1992, 1997 and 2002’, reinforcing its view that public land was allocated ‘as political reward or patronage’ (p.&nbsp;83).  '''II. Settlement Schemes & Trust Lands'''  * Trust land, including settlement scheme land purchased by government with international loans from European settlers for settlement by African smallholders or carved out of Trust land, has been similarly abused. The Commission found that, overall, whilst the establishment of settlement schemes and their subsequent allocation in the early years of independence generally conformed to the original objectives, in latter years there was extensive deviation, with much land having been allocated for purposes other than settlement and agricultural production.  * Allocation of plots, formally conducted under Settlement Fund Trustees, devolves in practice upon District Plot Allocation Committees composed of the District Commissioner, District Settlement Officer, District Agricultural Officer, the area MP, the Chairman of the relevant County Council and the Clerk to Council. Settlement Fund Trustees appear to lack any supervisory powers over these committees, with the result that the local committees have been almost wholly unaccountable. The result has been predictable, with the interests of the landless having been ignored in favour of those of ‘District officials, their relatives, Members of Parliament, Councillors and prominent politicians from the area, Ministry of Lands and Settlement officials, other civil servants and … so called ‘politically correct’ individuals’ (p.&nbsp;127). And whilst the majority of deserving allottees received smaller plots, the undeserving often received large ones. Meanwhile farms belonging to the Agricultural Development Corporation, designed to provide an the needs of the agricultural industry by developing high quality seeds or livestock or undertaking research etc., have been illegally established as settlement schemes and subsequently illegally allocated to individuals and companies, often as political reward or patronage (Commission: pp.&nbsp;134–5).  * Extensive tracts of Trust Land have been illegally allocated, with County Councillors having been the main beneficiaries. Whilst the Commission was able to provide some glaring examples of such abuse, it was hampered in its work by the failure or refusal of councils to submit relevant information (p.&nbsp;140). It concludes: ''Instead of playing their role as custodians of public resources including land, county and municipal councils have posed the greatest danger to these resources … the most pronounced land grabbers in these areas were the Councillors them-selves…The corruption within central government has been replicated at the local level through the activities and omissions of county and municipal councillors (Commission: p.147).''  '''III. Forestlands, National Parks, Game Reserves, Wetlands, Riparian Reserves & Protected Areas'''  * Only 1.7% of the 3% of the country which was covered by gazetted forests at independence remained, most of the reduction having come about as a result of illegal and irregular excisions, usually made without any reference to scientific considerations or under the guise of settlement schemes. The beneficiaries of such excisions include schools (often private), government institutions, and religious bodies as well as private individuals and companies.  * Land around riparian sites have been illegally allocated by the Kenya Wildlife Service, with many of the allocations – such as those made since 1995 to some 14 beneficiaries around Lake Naivasha – being known to have severely affected the ecosystem. Fortunately, the Commission finds that the National Parks and Reserves have been more effectively protected, yet nonetheless it provides some ten cases of illegal allocations within KWS protected areas, and 15 cases in KWS alienated plots beside them.  * The Commission recorded 26 instances of illegal allocations of land from Nature Reserves falling under the domain of local authorities, whilst there are some 8 known cases of land set aside for national museums and monuments having been illegally allocated to private individuals. The latter include the allocation of Kongo Mosque site at Kwale to former President Moi in 1986. It comes as no surprise that land belonging to the military, and even land portions belonging to State Houses and lodges, have also been sold off.  Through this catalog of corruption, the Commission concluded that there was systematic and widespread abuse of public trust by public officials, to the extent that many officials failed to see anything morally wrong with their allocating land illegally. T*here were many centers of power which were responsible for the illegal allocation of land, yet the Commission makes it clear that the lead in public plunder has consistently been given from the top. Kenya, it concludes, has fallen into a state of ‘moral decadence’, this epitomized no more clearly than by the extensive participation in land grabbing by churches, mosques, temples and other faith institutions, these including such venerable institutions as the Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi, the Church Commission of Kenya, and the Anglican Church.  ==Summary of Recommendations== The Commission made a series of recommendations<ref>Government of Kenya, Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land, June 2004</ref> for each of the three main categories as outlined above in the Summary of Findings, as well as a number of recommendation which apply to across the board.  * All allocations of public utility land  are illegal and should be nullified, and such lands should be repossessed and restored to the purpose for which they were intended; * Where land has been reserved for a public purpose, no consent to an application for change of user with respect to that land shall be granted unless the proposed change of user is in the public interest; * All public officials/persons/professionals who facilitated in or participated in the illegal allocation of public land should be investigated and prosecuted in accordance with the applicable penal law; * All lands reserved for the use or purposes of a Ministry, Department or any other government institutions which have since been illegally allocated to individuals or companies should be repossessed and restored to their original purpose, and titles acquired pursuant to the illegal allocations should be revoked; * All land allocations in settlement schemes which were made to people who were at the time public officers, Members of Parliament, area Councillors, political operatives,and other undeserving people, at the expense of the landless and contrary to established policy and procedures, should be revoked; * The Government should prepare a policy setting out the objectives and guidelines for the establishment, allocation and management of settlement schemes in the country; * All allocations of Trust Lands to individuals and companies contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, Trust Land Act and the Land Adjudication Act should be revoked; * The entire management structure of Trust Land should be re-examined and reformed; * All excisions of forestland which were made contrary to the provisions of the Forest Act and the Government Lands Act should be cancelled, and any titles revoked; the affected forestlands should be repossessed and restored to their original purpose; * All Gazetted forest boundaries should be resurveyed for validation and rectification; * All allocations of land within and around riparian areas and other wetlands should be cancelled and titles thereto revoked without exception; * The Government should undertake the survey and protection of riparian sites and other wetlands, and consequently stop the current human activity encroaching the following ares: Lake Naivasha, Lake Olbollosat, Lake Victoria, Lake Elementaita, Omo Delta on Lake Turkana, the Tana River Delta, and Indian Ocean coastline 100 feet inland from the high water mark. * Establishment of a Land Titles Tribunal to embark upon the process of revocation and rectification of titiles in the country; * Computerization of Land Records which should be made available to the public for inspection; * Insurance of Land Titles to eliminate risk and uncertainty of dealing with forged titles; * Establishment of a Land Commission vested with powers of allocating public land and supervising the management and allocation of Trust Land, while revoking the powers of the President and Commissioner of Lands; * Inventory of Public Land, since there is no complete record or register of public land in the country; * Harmonization of Land Legislation - at present there are more than 40 different statutes dealing with aspects of land administration, ownership and use; * Upgrading Informal Settlements in urban centres by establishing decent and affordable housing schemes; * Establishment of a Land Division of the High Court which would exclusively deal with land cases.  ==Outcomes==  {{Empty section|date=April 2013}}  ==Cost== In response to a query by [[Joseph Lekuton]], on 16 December 2008, [[Orwa Ojode]] the Assistant Minister for Provincial Administration and Internal Security confirmed to [[National Assembly of Kenya|Parliament]] that the Commission had cost the Kenya Government Ksh 77,812,169.<ref name="Kenya National Assembly Official Record (Hansard)">{{cite book|title=Kenya National Assembly Official Record (Hansard)|url=http://books.google.co.ke/books?id=6pEheyUSVnkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=8 January 2013|date=16 December 2008|page=4107}}</ref>  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{Kenya Government and Parliamentary Inquiries}}  [[Category:Human rights in Kenya]]</text></page>",

The founders of Houstoncon were Ray Bonario and Mark Schooley; Houston area entrepreneur, Earl Blair, Jr. was also a key member of the organizing committee.  Most Houstoncons took place over three days in June, From Friday to Sunday. The convention featured a large range of [[pop culture]] elements, primarily [[comic books]] but also [[serial (radio and television)|television serials]], [[science fiction]]/fantasy (particularly ''[[Star Trek]]''), film/television, animation, toys, and [[horror fiction|horror]]. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals, the Houstoncon often featured screenings of old television serials, and such evening events as a costume contest. The convention featured a large floorspace for exhibitors, including comic book dealers and [[collectibles]] merchants. The show included an autograph area, as well as an Artists' Alley where comics artists signed autographs and sold or did free sketches. (Despite the name, Artists' Alley could include writers and even [[glamour models]].)  ==History== Roy Bonario, Gene Arnold, Marc Schooley and a group of Houston-based comic book fans founded the Houston Comic Collector's Association in 1966; the HCCA, spearheaded by Bonario and fellow enthusiasts Mark Schooley and Jerry Poscovsky, put on the first Houstoncon (officially known as the '''Houston Comic Convention''')<ref>[[Maggie Thompson|Thompson, Maggie]].

By 1973, the partnership with Southwesterncon was dissolved and Houstoncon became an annual event,{{cn|date=April 2013}} at this point being run by Blair, with the help of legendary fandom publisher [[G. B. Love]].  Houstoncon 1973 was held June 21–24 at the Marriott Motor Hotel in Houston, attracting over 2,000 attendees; guests include [[Kirk Alyn]], [[Frank Coghlan, Jr.]], [[William Benedict]], [[William Witney]], [[Dave Sharpe]], [[Al Williamson]], and [[Don Newton]].

For the 1976 and 1977 editions, Schooley and Bonario resumed control with Blair consulting. Guests of the 1977 show included [[Frank Brunner]], [[George "Spanky" McFarland|Spanky McFarland]], [[Jock Mahoney]], [[George Takei]], [[Forrest J Ackerman]], and [[Roy Rogers]].  Houstoncon '78 guests include [[Frankie Thomas]], [[Kirk Alyn]], [[Ron Goulart]], [[Gil Kane]], [[Jenette Kahn]], [[Frank Brunner]], [[Ray Harryhausen]], [[Greg Jein]], Jim Newsome, and Paula Crist.  Houstoncon '79 guests included [[Walter Koenig]] and [[George Pérez]].  Houstoncon '80 took place June 20–22; featured guests included [[George Pérez]].  The final Houstoncon, held in June 1982, was also known as "Ultimate Fantasy" (and later "The Con of Wrath"). Scheduled for shortly after the release of ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', Ultimate Fantasy assembled the entire main cast of the original [[Star Trek: The Original Series|''Star Trek'' TV series]] as guests of the show, which was promoted with magazine advertising, laser light shows, billboards, a huge venue, and other promotional gimmicks. Due to poor sales, however, only a few hundred people attended the convention; the resulting debacle is now the subject of a [http://www.larrynemecek.com/conofwrath.htm documentary film].  === Legacy === From 1983–1996, Houston was the site of the annual [[Comix Fair]], a smaller-scale convention primarily focused on comic books.  On August 7–8, 1993, the University of Houston hosted the first annual [[Houston Comic Book Festival]], with official guests [[Chris Claremont]], [[Matt Wagner]], [[Kelley Jones]], [[Joe St. Pierre]], [[Evan Dorkin]], and [[Mike Leeke]].  In 2001 local retailer Bedrock City Comics produced a "Houstoncon" show on September 15–16 (shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]]) at the Holiday Inn.

"<page><title>Arthur S. Reber</title><text> {{Orphan|date=July 2014}}  '''Arthur S. Reber''' (born 1940) is an American cognitive psychologist. He is a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS), the [[Association for Psychological Science]] (APS) and a [[Fulbright Foundation|Fulbright]] Fellow. He is known for introducing the concept of [[implicit learning]] and for using basic principles of [[evolutionary biology]] to show how implicit or unconscious cognitive functions differ in fundamental ways from those carried out consciously.  ==Career== Reber was born in Philadelphia, PA. He received his B.A. in 1961 from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in psychology, working with Justin Aronfreed and [[Richard Solomon (psychologist)|Richard Solomon]] and his M.A. in 1965 and Ph.D. degree in 1967 from [[Brown University]] under Richard Millward. He taught at the [[University of British Columbia]] from 1966 to 1970 when he moved to [[Brooklyn College]] and the [[CUNY Graduate Center|Graduate Center]] of the [[City University of New York]]. In 1998 he was appointed Broeklundian Professor of Psychology. He spent 1977-78 as a Fulbright Professor at the [[University of Innsbruck|University of Innsbruck, Austria]] and 1995-96 as a Visiting Scholar at the [[University of Wales, Bangor]]. He retired in 2005 but maintains a Visiting Professor position at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada and continues to work with colleagues and former students.  ==Research==  ===Implicit learning=== His M.S. thesis was the first demonstration of [[implicit learning]], a form of learning that takes place without awareness of either the process of acquisition or knowledge of what was actually learned. Those experiments<ref name="ftn1">Reber, A. S. (1967). Implicit learning of artificial grammars. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior'', '''6''', 855‑863.</ref> used the [[artificial grammar learning]] methods where participants memorize strings of letters that appear chaotic but are actually formed according to complex rules. After the learning period they are able to discern whether new, novel letter-strings are "grammatical" (i.e., conform to the rules) or "non-grammatical" (i.e., violate the rules) without being able to articulate the rules they are using. These processes have much in common with the notion of [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]] where people often find themselves able to make effective decisions without being aware of the knowledge they are using, how, or even when, they acquired it. His 1993 book, ''Implicit Learning and Tacit Knowledge: An Essay on the Cognitive Unconscious'' reviews the early decades of research on the topic.  A variety of other techniques have been developed to study implicit cognitive functions and a host of related phenomena have been explored including [[implicit memory]], the [[Implicit Association Test]], the role of implicit acquisition in [[language learning]] and [[socialization]] and the multi-national, multi-university Project Implicit.  Not all agree that implicit cognitive functions invariably lie outside of awareness. Researchers such as David Shanks, Pierre Perruchet and Lee Brooks have argued that implicit or [[tacit knowledge]] may, in fact, be available to consciousness<ref name="ftn2">Shanks, D. & St. John, M. (1994). Characteristics of dissociable human learning-systems. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', '''17''', 367-395.</ref> and that much of this tacit knowledge is not based on rules or patterns but on fragments, concrete exemplars and instances.<ref name="ftn3">Perruchet, P. & Pacteau, S.

Abstract analogies and abstracted grammars. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General'', '''120''', 316-323.</ref>  ===Evolutionary theory=== Reber developed a model based on the assumption that the underlying mechanisms that control implicit learning are based on evolutionarily old [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and sub-cortical structures, ones that emerged long before those that modulate conscious control and self-reflection.<ref name="ftn5">Reber, A. S. (1992). The cognitive unconscious: An evolutionary perspective.

S. (1997). Caterpillars and consciousness. ''Philosophical Psychology, 10,'' 437-450.</ref> We would do better to treat consciousness like we treat [[memory]], not as a singular thing but as a label for a host of functions all of which have a common functional core. Cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists are, he notes, quite comfortable viewing memory as beginning in very basic functions of cellular biology (as [[Eric Kandel]] has shown) while still recognizing the various complex and sophisticated forms we see in humans as on a continuum with the primitive forms.  ===Lexicography=== In 1985 Reber authored the ''Dictionary of Psychology'', now in its 4th edition. His daughter Emily Reber co-authored the 3rd edition and his wife Rhianon Allen joined for the most recent edition. The dictionary has sold over a half-million copies in six languages.  ===A Separate Career=== In addition to his work in cognitive psychology and the philosophy of mind, Reber has had a parallel career as a reporter and commentator on gambling, particularly poker. As a free-lance writer, he has authored hundreds of columns, most from the psychologist’s point of view. These have been published in magazines such as Casino Player, Strictly Slots and Poker Pro Magazine and web sites like PokerListings.com. His breakdown of forms of gambling based on [[expected value]] was presented in ''The New Gambler’s Bible''. An overview of gaming appeared in ''Gambling for Dummies'' (co-authored with Richard Harroch and Lou Krieger) and recently he published ''Poker, Life and Other Confusing Things'', a collection of essays. In 2012 he proposed a novel framework for the notion "[[gambling]]" based on the two dimensions of expected value of a game and the flexibility that a game affords each player.<ref name="ftn12">Reber, A.

"<page><title>Gregorian Tower</title><text>{{Good article}} [[File:Musei Vaticani.jpg|thumb|Gregorian Tower (centre left)]] The '''Gregorian Tower''' ({{lang-it|Torre Gregoriana}})  or '''Tower of the Winds''' ({{lang-it|Torre dei Venti}}) is a round tower located above the [[Gallery of Maps]], which connects the Villa Belvedere with the [[Apostolic Palace]]  in [[Vatican City]]. The tower was built between 1578 and 1580 to a design by the [[Bologna|Bolognese]] architect [[Ottaviano Mascherino]] (who was credited with building the Apostolic Palace) mainly to promote the study of [[astronomy]] for the [[Gregorian Calendar]] Reform which was commissioned by Pope [[Gregory XIII]] and promulgated in 1582. It was then also known as the Tower of Winds.<ref name="Michelin2007">{{cite book|author=Manufacture française des pneumatiques Michelin|title=Italia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GL-asS2CWsgC&pg=PA323|date=2007|publisher=La Guida verde Michelin|isbn=978-2-06-712450-9|page=323|language=Italian}}</ref><ref name=Tower>{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiviosegretovaticano.va/en/archivio/ambienti/torre-dei-venti/|title=The Tower of Winds|accessdate=9 May 2013|publisher=Archivum Secretum Vaticanum}}</ref> The tower is now called the "Specola Astronomica Vaticana", the Vatican Observatory. Four stages of progressive development have occurred since it was first established. The tower was an edifice of great value for astronomical observations made using a [[sundial]] as they provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the [[Julian calendar]].  ==Early history== [[File:Gregory XIII.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Pope Gregory XIII]] (Pope from 1572 to 1585) who established the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and the Gregorian Tower.]] The first stage of building of the tower, as recorded by [[Leo XIII]] in his  [[motu proprio]] ''Ut mysticam'' of 1891,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ut Mysticam, Motu proprio circa la rifondazione e l’ampliamento della Specola Vaticana|date=14 March 1891|url=http://www.disf.org/Documentazione/05-leoneXIII.asp|accessdate=17 May 2013|author=Pope Leo XIII|authorlink=Pope Leo XIII|language=Italian}}</ref> is credited to Pope [[Gregory XIII]], Pope from 1572 to 1585. The directive was to build a tower at a suitable location in the Vatican and equip it with the "greatest and best instruments of the time".<ref name=Vatican>{{CathEncy|author=Hagen, Johann Georg |wstitle=Vatican Observatory|authorlink=Johann Georg Hagen}}</ref>  The design was effected after a series of meetings of the experts who had been appointed to reform the [[Julian calendar]], in use since 45 BC, to verify their proposed reforms. Fr. [[Christoph Clavius]], a [[Jesuit]] mathematician from the [[Roman College]], was the expert on the committee who suggested the new system for the observations. The {{Convert|73|m}} tower was then built above the museum and library, flanked by the Belvedere and della Pigna courtyards. The instrumentation for the observation of the sun rays falling over it consisted of a [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian line]] designed by [[Ignazio Danti]] of [[Perugia]]. It was in the form of a circular marble plate in the centre, embellished with scientific designs. The tower still remains today, but has undergone improvements over the centuries.<ref name=Vatican/>  ==Second stage== The second stage of construction in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the tower was under the charge of the Vatican librarian, involved Mgr. Filippo Luigi Gilii, a clergyman of [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Earlier in 1797, Pius VI gave approval to placing a [[Latin]] inscription ''Specula Vaticana'' at the entrance to the upper part of the tower, which was implemented by Cardinal Zelada with plans to enhance the instrumentation system in the tower's [[observatory]].<ref name=Vatican/> The original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of [[Pope Pius VI]]. Its instrumentation, apart from many normal devices (such as meteorological and magnetic equipment, with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock,<ref name=Vatican/>) was noted for the Dolland Telescope. The instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of [[eclipse]], appearance of [[comets]], [[Satellites of Jupiter]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]’s [[Astronomical transit|transit]]. As an addition, under the patronage of [[Pope Pius X]], four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the {{Convert|1300|ft}} long fortification walls, more than a thousand years old.<ref name="Romero2011">{{cite book|author=Romero, George|title=The Rescue|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fHZStF5WgTEC&pg=PA220|date=18 March 2011|publisher=George Romero|isbn=978-1-4564-9962-4|pages=220–}}</ref> Mgr. Gilii, highly respected as a [[polyglot]] with a knowledge of physics, biology, archeology and the [[Hebrew language]], was in charge of the observatory from 1800 to 1821. He carried out continuous meteorological observations (twice a day at 6 AM and 2 PM) conforming to the programme of the [[Mannheim Meteorological Society]]. While the observation records for seven years were published, the balance data in a [[manuscript]] form was preserved in the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=Vatican/><ref name="Romero2011"/> Subsequent to Gilii's death in 1821, the observatory on the tower was discontinued and the instruments were moved to the observatory at the [[Roman College]].  Established in 1787, it was considered more suitable for making observations than the Vatican.<ref name=Vatican/>  ==Third stage== The revival of the observatory on the Gregorian Tower was initiated by the [[Barnabite]] [[Francesco Denza]] with the approval of [[Pope Leo XIII]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Francesco Denza|author=Brock, Henry Matthias}}</ref> High quality instruments were procured, partly with generous donations from Hicks of [[London]], and the automatic recording instruments were procured from Richard in [[Paris]].<ref name=HerbermannPacePallen1913>{{cite book|last1= Herbermann |first=Charles George |last2= Pace |first2=Edward Aloysius |last3= Pallen |first3=Condé Bénoist |first4=Thomas Joseph|last4=Shahan |first5=John Joseph |last5=Wynne |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3FEsAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA310|date=1913|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia Incorporated|p=310}}</ref> A four-inch equatorial, a three-inch transit instrument, and four pendulum clocks with two chronometers, were also procured from the observatory at [[Modena]]. In 1888, the gift of a 16 inch long telescope to [[Pope Leo XIII]], became a part of the observatory.<ref name=Vatican/><ref name="Romero2011"/> Father Denza joined the observatory in 1889 after it was upgraded with more modern instruments. The same year, a second tower was built some {{Convert|400|m}} away from the main Gregorian Tower, overlooking the Vatican Gardens behind [[St. Peter's Basilica]] on the south-west border. It was built to a diameter of {{Convert|17|m}} with a lower wall thickness of {{Convert|4.5|m}}, which could bear the load of a 13 inch photographic refractor, newly procured from Paris.<ref name=Vatican/> Augustinian Father Rodriguez was the expert meteorologist who held the post of director from 1898 to 1905. In 1891, Pope Leo XIII, promulgating the [[motu proprio]] ''Ut mysticam'', designated the second tower as the seat of the newly established [[Vatican Observatory]], a decision which required altering the roof to provide a flat terrace for astronomical observations.<ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996">{{cite book|author1=Ambrosini, Maria Luisa|author2=Willis, Mary|title=The Secret Archives of the Vatican|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Cc9A9_DIQ4C&pg=PA327|date=19 February 1996|publisher=Barnes & Noble, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-7607-0125-6|pages=327}}</ref>  ==Fourth stage== The fourth stage involved remedying the problem of communicating between the two towers during the time of [[Pope Pius X]]. His plans were to make the Gregorian Tower into a historical tower and to record and carry out observations at the second tower by linking the two towers along the fortified wall with a {{convert|83|m}} iron bridge spanning the gap.<ref name=Vatican/> At the west end of this bridge, a four-inch [[equatorial coordinates|equatorial]] was installed on semicircular bastion. The east end of the bridge, above the barracks of the gendarmes, had a [[heliograph]], with a camera attached, used to photograph the Sun (photoheliograph). A new 16-inch visual [[telescope]], called Torre Pio X, was erected in the second tower.<ref name=Vatican/> As a result of these modifications, the original library was moved to the Pontifical Academy Lincei, and the old meteorological and seismic instruments were shifted to the [[Valle di Pompei]] observatory. The new Astronomical Library was housed in two rooms of the building. The two new Repsold machines were used for recording on the astrographic plates. The recorded observations were published along with explanatory notes together with the last two series of the atlas of stars. Charts were printed on [[silver bromide]] paper.<ref name=Vatican/>  ==Features== The tower had two floors and a [[mezzanine]]. On the first floor was the famous Sundial Room or Meridian Room, which was initially an open [[loggia]]. Pope [[Urban VIII]] had it enclosed and it was subsequently decorated with long sequences of frescoes painted between 1580 and 1582 by [[Simon Lagi]] and the two Flemish artists [[Paul Matthijs|Paul]] and [[Matthijs Bril]]. Today the tower has paintings by [[Cristoforo Roncalli]] and [[Matteino da Siena]].<ref name=Tower/><ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996"/>  The Sundial Room, also called the Meridian Hall, was once the residence of Queen [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Christina of Sweden]], then newly converted to [[Catholicism]]. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated [[anemoscope]] which was fixed to the ceiling of the Meridian Hall. These were created by [[Ignazio Danti]], the papal [[cosmographer]], in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.<ref name=Tower/><ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996"/>  The observations made with the sundial provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the [[Julian calendar]].<ref name=Tower/><ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996"/> The [[anemoscope]], in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at [[Athens]] was also called the [[Tower of the Winds]] and might have been the source for inspiration.<ref name=Tower/><ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996"/>  The interior walls and ceiling of the hall were richly decorated, in some cases with gaudy frescoes of the hills and Roman countryside, the [[Pantheon (gods)|Pantheon]]s, religious themes, the buildings surrounding the area, and naval shipwrecks with Jesus calming the storm and so forth.<ref name="AmbrosiniWillis1996"/>  ==See also== *[[Vatican Observatory]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==Further reading== ;Articles * de Solla Price, Derek J.

"<page><title>List of fifth intervals</title><text>In the [[music theory|theory]] and practice of [[music]], a '''fifth&nbsp;[[interval (music)|interval]]''' is an [[ordered pair]] of [[note]]s that are separated by 6–8 [[semitone]]s.  There are three types of fifth intervals, namely * [[perfect fifth|''perfect'' fifth]]s  (7 semitones), * [[tritone|''diminished'' fifth]] (6 semitones), and * [[augmented fifth]] (8 semitones).  After the [[unison]] and [[octave]] intervals, the ''perfect fifth'' is the most important interval in tonal harmony. It is highly [[consonance|consonant]]. Its implementation in [[equal&nbsp;temperament]] tuning is highly accurate, unlike the [[major third]] interval, for example. As explained below, it is used to generate the [[chromatic circle]] and the [[cycle of fifths]], and it is used for [[all-fifths tuning|tuning string-instruments]]. It is a constituent interval for the fundamental chords of tonal harmony.  ==Tonal harmony== The fundamental chords of [[tonal harmony|tonal music]]—[[major triad|major]] and [[minor triad]]s and also [[seventh chord]]s—all contain fifth intervals. *''Perfect'' fifths are contained in major and minor triads and in particular seventh chords (especially [[major-minor seventh]]s with [[dominant seventh|dominant function]], [[major seventh]]s, and [[minor seventh]]s). *''Diminished'' fifths are contained in [[diminished triad]]s and in [[half-diminished seventh]]s and [[diminished seventh|fully diminished seventh]] chords.  Fifths are stacked to form chords in [[quintal harmony]].  ===Cycle of fifths=== [[Image:Pitch class space star.svg|thumb|right|The [[circle of fifths]] drawn within the chromatic circle as a [[regular polygon|regular]] [[star polygon|star]] [[dodecagon]]<ref>{{harvtxt|McCartin|1998|p=364}}: {{cite journal|title=Prelude to musical geometry|first=Brian J.|last=McCartin|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=29|number=5|date=November 1998|pages=354–370|url=http://www.maa.org/pubs/cmj_Nov98.html|jstor=2687250|id={{subscription required}}|ref=harv}}</ref>]]  Concatenating the perfect fifths <big>(</big>(F,C), (C,G), (G,D), (D,A), (A,E), (E,B),...<big>)</big> generates the [[cycle of fifths|sequence of fifths]] (F,C,G,D,A,E,B,F{{music|sharp}},...); this [[sequence]] of fifths  displays all twelve notes of the [[chromatic circle]].<ref>This sequence of [[list of fifths|fifths]] features the  [[diminished&nbsp;fifth]]&nbsp;(b,f), which replaces the perfect&nbsp;fifth  (b,f{{music|sharp}}) containing the [[chromaticism|chromatic]] note&nbsp;f{{music|sharp}}, which is not a member of the [[C major|C-major]]&nbsp;[[major key|key]].

It was passed into law on 8 October 2002 in the [[Parliament of New Zealand]]. The Act changed the existing law to enable Crown organisations - [[Crown entity|Crown entities]], government departments, or government-related organisations - to be prosecuted for offences under the Building Act and the [[Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992]]. While Crown organisations were required to comply with both pieces of legislation since their enactment, it was not previously possible to prosecute those organisations for offences committed under either Act.  The Act is designed "to protect society and the individual from harm or danger arising from actions of the Crown by ensuring that there are mechanisms to hold the Crown responsible and accountable for its actions [and to] meet the principle that the Crown should in general be subject to the law and the same legal processes as anyone else."<ref>{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=[[New Zealand Parliament]] | url=http://www.vdig.net/hansard/content.jsp?id=85442 | house=[[House of Representatives of New Zealand]]| date=3 May 2001|speaker=[[Phil Goff]] |position=Minister of Justice}}</ref> It is administered by the [[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]].  ==Background== The Act was created in response to a Commission of Inquiry into the [[Cave Creek disaster]], headed by District Judge Graeme S. Noble. Cave Creek is a small stream in Paparoa National Park. A viewing platform was erected by the Department of Conservation (DOC) in April 1994, which looked out over a 30-metre chasm with a view of where the creek emerges from a cave system below. The commission discovered that the [[cantilever]]ed platform had been constructed by well-intentioned but unqualified volunteers without on-site plans or formal building approval.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecotourism: A Practical Guide for Rural Communities|first=Sue|last=Beeton|publisher=Landlinks Press|year=1998|location=Collingwood|edition=Reprint|page=139|isbn=9780643063594}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Comparing Westminster|first1=R.A.W.|last1=Rhodes|first2=John|last2=Wanna|first3=Patrick|last3=Weller|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=2009|page=117|isbn=9780199563494}}</ref> The platform was highly unsafe, especially with large numbers of people on it.
